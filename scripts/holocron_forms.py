"""The shapes of the four loot-box holocrons, for `holocron_assets.py`.

Each tier is its own object (Sol's pick, 17/10/2026, from the proposals' second set):

- uncommon, the Jedi cube: Sol's sculpted model (08/11/2026), a steel-framed cube with
  glowing green glass round an emblem plate on each face (a low poly with its detail
  baked into pictures);
- rare, the Great Holocron: a dodecahedron with a raised pentagon in each face, lit
  edges, and a broken halo turning around it;
- legendary, the Sith pyramid: Sol's sculpted model (05/11/2026), a dark frustum on a
  plinth with glowing runes carved down its sides, its cap floating free over a glowing
  eye, both bobbing and turning (a low poly with its detail baked into pictures);
- mythical, the engram (21/10/2026, Sol: "make a cool shader of it like Destiny"; Sol's
  sculpted model since 08/11/2026): a lumpy gem of 38 engraved triangular gold plates,
  each a slab apart from the next with glowing seams between them and a white-hot core
  showing through, the plates breathing outward and back (their shader's `deformVertexes
  wave`), the shell turning and slowly tumbling, a sheen running over the plates, eight
  sparks circling it.

The kyber crystals (`kyber_<tier>`, 21/10/2026) are one more object in the four tiers'
colours: what was the mythical holocron until then, the kyber prism, a broad
eight-sided crystal in a steel sheath, turning, held by gimbal rings that tumble, motes
of light circling it. The commoner the tier the plainer: one ring and four motes for
uncommon, six motes for rare, both rings and eight for legendary, ten for mythical.

A form is one model per part: its body, which never moves against the holocron, and
each moving part (the halo, the cap and the eye, the crystal, the rings, a mote), so
that the client can turn each one ([`PARTS`], mirrored by `holocrons/stage.rs`'s
table: keep the two in step). A moving part is modelled about its own centre, which
the motion turns it about; the body about the holocron's centre. Units are the
model's (the Jedi cube's edge is about 6), z up.

A part's surfaces are grouped by material (one MD3 surface each): a material is a
picture and a shader of the same name (`models/sjk/<material>`), written by
`holocron_assets.py`. The locked look (a tier the player holds none of) is the same
geometry with every material swapped for its locked one ([`locked_material`]).

Also here: a small software renderer that draws the posed parts for the tiers' UI
icons ([`render`]).
