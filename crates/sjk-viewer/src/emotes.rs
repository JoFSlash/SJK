//! Emotes (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "Emotes in the client"): short animations an SJK
//! player plays, which other SJK players on the same game server see. They travel
//! through the SJK hub, not the game server, so stock servers and clients know
//! nothing of them.
//!
//! This is the groundwork: the catalogue's format and loader, the `sjkemote` command
//! (named apart from the `emote` some server mods have),
//! and [`ActiveEmotes`], which says which player plays which emote right now. The
//! animations, sounds and art are separate work: an emote's torso and legs
//! animations and sound are named in its catalogue file, and the player's model
//! code reads [`active`] to play them. Until then a received emote is written to the
//! console.
//!
//! The catalogue is data in the game's file system (pk3s or the folder):
//! `emotes/<id>.emote`, a JSON object:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"name": "Wave", "torso": "BOTH_...", "legs": "", "length_ms": 2500,
//!  "loop": false, "sound": "sound/emotes/wave.mp3", "clip": "", "local": false,
//!  "moving": false, "icon": "gfx/emotes/wave.png"}
//! ```
//!
//! `clip` names an animation of a rig model (`docs/rig-models.md`): a player wearing
//! a rig that has it plays it on the rig's own skeleton. `rig` names the model folder
//! the clip comes from: other rig models with the same joint names borrow it. `local` keeps the emote on
//! this client: it plays here and is never sent to the hub (an emote made for a
//! model only this player has). `moving` keeps it playing while the player moves.
//! The sound plays on the player and stops when the emote is cut short. With its
//! length (`sound_ms`) a looping emote plays it again each time it ends, and
//! `sound_loop` (its length `sound_loop_ms`) follows the first sound and repeats
//! for as long as the emote plays (music with an intro and a loop). `icon` is a
//! picture (PNG, JPG or TGA) the quick wheel shows for it (`emote_icons.rs`). The id
//! [`STOP`] ends the player's emote; `sjkemote stop all` or `sjkemote stop <player>`
//! ends other players' on this screen only, once (their next emote plays).
//! [`MUTE`] (`sjkemote mute <player>`) hides a player's emotes on this screen until
//! [`UNMUTE`] or the game closes; it holds their identity key, so it follows them
//! across slots and names. `<player>` is a slot number, part of a name, or
//! [`TARGET`], the player under the crosshair.
//!
//! `<id>` is the emote's id at the hub: 1 to 32 of `a` to `z`, `0` to `9` and `_`.
//!
//! [`SYNC`] (`sjkemote sync [player]`) joins another player's emote in step: the hub
//! relays the leader's slot with it, and each client starts the follower at the
//! leader's start as that client saw it ([`ActiveEmotes::sync`]), so the two dance in
//! phase on every screen whatever each one's delay. The follower's music starts
//! where the leader's is, so both play it in step.
