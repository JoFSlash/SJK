//! The Profile page: the player's SJK profile as others see it on the hub (picture,
//! name, verified flag, names worn, medals and bio), their own record from the
//! achievement counts, and the way to their achievements and collection
//! (`docs/identity.md`, "Profile", "Pictures", "Medals" and "Achievements"). The bio is written here, under
//! the hub's rules (`sjk_identity::bio`): what cannot be in a bio cannot be typed, and
//! what the hub sends back is shown only through those rules.
//!
//! The picture is changed here too: the player's picture on the left opens the picture
//! panel in the bio's place. A picture file chosen with Browse... (the system's file
//! dialog, opened on a worker thread), dropped on the window or named to the
//! `sjkavatar` command is read on a worker thread, checked, cropped and scaled
//! (`avatars::picture`) and shown as a preview; Use this picture sends it to the hub.
//!
//! In the SJK UI it is the Profile screen's SJK Profile tab ([`crate::profile_hub`],
//! [`Mode::Hub`]); its See the board and See the collection open the Collection screen
//! (`collection_panel`). In the classic menus the `profile` command opens it on its own,
//! the medals on the profile ([`Mode::Pages`]), and its buttons open the Collection page
//! on its own. Like the Identity page it lives in the console and is drawn in place of
//! it, always in the SJK UI's look ([`view`]). Tab moves between the picture, the bio
//! and their buttons; Enter saves the bio from the field (Shift+Enter starts a new
//! line); Escape goes back.
//!
//! The bio has a caret ([`crate::text_dialog::field`], as the report dialog's text):
//! a click places it, Left and Right (a word with Ctrl), Up and Down, Home and End (the
//! text's ends with Ctrl) move it, typing, pasting and Backspace or Delete work at it,
//! and Ctrl+A selects all of it (Kushina's report, 22/10/2026: only the end could be
//! written).
//!
//! The name emoji (`sjk_identity::name_emoji`, Sol's request 16/10/2026) is picked
//! here too: the Name emoji button under who the player is opens the emoji panel in the
//! bio's place, a grid of [`EMOJI_CHOICES`]. A click (or Enter on the grid, moved with
//! the arrows) sends the one picked at once; any other single emoji typed or pasted
//! there (the system's emoji panel, Win+.) is sent the same way; Remove emoji takes it
//! away. Everyone sees it at the right of the player's name.
