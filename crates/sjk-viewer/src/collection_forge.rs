//! The Collection's Forge tab (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, Collection; `docs/cards.md`, "The
//! Forge"; Sol's request of 21/10/2026: "a better interface for the shop, for crafting
//! sabers and for disassembling them", a tab of its own). Everything the holocron economy
//! trades, in three sections switched by the chips under the headline:
//!
//! - **Shop:** the player's four offers of the day as large cards with their live blades,
//!   price and state, the countdown to midnight in Paris, and the holocrons credits buy.
//! - **Craft:** every saber shader of the trade the player does not hold, as a grid or a
//!   list (V, `ui_shaderList` as on Shaders), with the tier chips, an Affordable chip and a
//!   search; the one chosen big on the right with its blade, its parts, its cost against
//!   the player's kyber shards, and Craft.
//! - **Break down:** the player's own copies of shaders of the trade, the duplicates first
//!   with their count; the one chosen big on the right with what breaking a copy gives, and
//!   Break down a copy; Break down all duplicates keeps one of each. The last copy breaks
//!   down too on a hub that says so (`shatter_last`, 21/10/2026: Sol's promise of breaking
//!   down any saber shader a player owns, never a card's or a medal's), after a stronger
//!   warning; against an older hub only duplicates are listed.
//!
//! Every purchase, craft and break down asks twice, as the shop always did: the first
//! press arms the button ("Confirm: ..."), a second within five seconds sends it. The
//! last copy and all duplicates ask with a card over the page instead. The balances stand
//! at the top right, with how each is earned in their hover cards.
//!
//! Keys: Tab and Shift+Tab (or 1, 2, 3) change section; the arrows choose; Enter or Space
//! presses the chosen thing's button; V switches the grid and the list, `/` (or Ctrl+F)
//! types in the search, T steps the tier, A shows the affordable only (Craft), D the
//! duplicates only and B breaks down all duplicates (Break down); Ctrl+Tab changes tab
//! and Escape leaves, as on every tab. Since 29/10/2026 (collection marks,
//! `crate::shader_marks`) F stars the chosen shader and L locks it, on a hub that keeps
//! them, and Shift+F shows Break down's favourites alone: favourites are listed first, and
//! a locked shader is never broken down (its button says so) nor counted among all
//! duplicates.
