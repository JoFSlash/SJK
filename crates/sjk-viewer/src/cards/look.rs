//! A card drawn from shapes (`docs/cards.md`, "In the client"): a sealed card shows its
//! back, a dark plate edged in its rarity's colour with the holocron's gem at its heart,
//! its rarity above, "Sealed" under the gem and its edition stamped at the foot. A
//! revealed card shows its face ([`super::faces`]), laid out as a trading card: its name
//! and a dot of its rarity's colour on top, its picture in a gold-edged 6:5 window, a
//! strip with its kind and set and its edition and finish, its lore in a box, and at the
//! foot its artist and its rarity (no number: it stays the card's id). The finish lies over it all,
//! shaded per pixel by the renderer ([`sjk_ui::CardShine`]): Holo a smooth rainbow foil sweeping
//! across the card with a glint, Solar the Sun blade's living corona burning along the
//! card's edge with flares running round it and sparks, a gold edge and a faint band of
//! sunlight over the face. One drawing serves the Cards tab, the opening's
//! ceremony and the card on show. A small card shows a face's picture without its words
//! ([`WORDS`], [`TITLE`]), or with its name under it on the Cards tab's tiles
//! ([`Card::label`]); a face's lore grows to fill its box when it is short ([`lore_fit`]).
//!
//! A card is a fixed number of commands for its finish ([`commands`]): nothing is
//! allocated, and the canvas's room is counted by the tests.
