//! Card faces (`docs/cards.md`, "Faces"): what a revealed card shows, read from the SJK
//! packs the hub serves (`sjk_cards`, [`crate::sjk_packs`]). Each card is a file
//! `cards/<id>.card` (JSON: its name, set, number, kind, rarity, lore, artist and the game
//! path of its picture) beside its picture, a JPEG or PNG framed for the card's art
//! window ([`ART_ASPECT`]). The hub keeps which card each copy is; the pack says what it
//! looks like, so a client draws a card it has the face of and shows "Unknown card"
//! (its id) for one it has not.
//!
//! The faces are read whenever the packs are mounted ([`install`]), each picture kept as
//! the pack's file. A picture is decoded only when a screen draws its face ([`request`]):
//! on a worker thread, squeezed into a square mip chain the UI renderer uploads
//! (`ui_renderer/card_art.rs`) and drawn back into the 6:5 window, which undoes the
//! squeeze. Until then the window stays dark. Decoding and uploading every face at
//! start held 1.8 GB of video memory and as much system memory for the hub's 333
//! faces, more than a 3 GB card has (`docs/cards.md`, "Faces").
