//! The Collection's Shaders tab: the saber's looks as a wall of tiles, a heading to each
//! tier, or as a list whose columns sort it ([`SHADER_VIEW_CVAR`], switched by V or the
//! two marks by the kinds; Sol's pick of 25/10/2026, the Collection revamp's canvas): the
//! stock blade first in the player's colour, then every blade skin
//! (`docs/unlockables.md`), the rarest tier first, each framed in its tier's colour, alive
//! when owned, a still ghost of its own colours when not. A strip of the tiers over them
//! says how many of each the player holds and filters by one. The one chosen is the blade
//! the stage shows on its own beside the page ([`Backstage`]), a locked one too, as a
//! preview only this screen draws; its card under it says what it is, since when it is
//! the player's or how to get it, and Equip or Unequip, and grows upward to hold all its
//! words. Body shaders, for the whole character, are to come: their kind is shown, not
//! yet offered.
//!
//! Since 29/10/2026 every shader carries its marks (`crate::shader_marks`): a New sticker
//! for one gained since the player last looked, and, on a hub that keeps them, a star for
//! a favourite (listed first, under a heading of their own by tier) and a padlock for one
//! the player locked against breaking down and trading; the card's two toggles, F and L set
//! them, Shift+F shows the favourites alone and N marks every New one seen.
