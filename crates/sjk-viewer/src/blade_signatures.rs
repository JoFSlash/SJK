//! Blade Lab signature shaders: blade skins drawn by their own shader from Creyon's Blade
//! Lab (`docs/rendering.md`, "Blade Lab signature shaders").
//!
//! The lab (a three.js page) draws each blade with SJK's own skin shading ported to GLSL,
//! and lets a blade add a *signature*: `sig_glow`, `sig_core` and `sig_solid`, which take
//! what the skin's file drew and return the blade's own light, core and solid layer. The
//! signatures' GLSL lives in `blade_signatures/` beside its WGSL translation
//! (`scripts/blade_signatures.py`). A skin this table names is drawn by `saber.wgsl` as its
//! file says, each pass then handing its result to the signature (the `LAB_SIGNATURE`
//! design number); its pipelines are built from `saber.wgsl` with the stand-in signature
//! replaced by its own ([`module_source`]), once a blade wears it, off the render thread
//! (`saber_gpu.rs`). Until they are built the blade is drawn from its file alone.
//!
//! A signature skin whose file is in no pack is drawn from the lab's file built in here
//! ([`Signature::default_file`]), so the skins show (in the Collection's preview, and on
//! whoever is given one) before the hub's pack carries them.
