//! Toys that stay on until the player turns them off (Sol's request, 22/10/2026): Order 66,
//! the Hax, the Drone, the Monitor, Box hunt and the Banana peel keep their switch in an
//! archived cvar ([`ORDER66_CVAR`], [`HAX_CVAR`], [`DRONE_CVAR`], [`MONITOR_CVAR`],
//! [`BOX_HUNT_CVAR`], [`BANANA_CVAR`]), so
//! a toy turned on is still on after a map change, another server or a restart of the
//! game. The toy's own state stays the viewer's; [`Saved::sync`] keeps the two in step
//! once a frame, the cvar winning when it was set from the console or a config.
