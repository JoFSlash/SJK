//! The SJK chat page (`docs/hub-chat.md`): the chat every SJK player shares through
//! the SJK hub, in full. The history with names, verified and staff marks and how
//! long ago each message came; a field to write in and Send; a small window of who is
//! online and who was seen most recently ([`people`]); and, for a chosen message, Mute
//! on this PC, Ban 24 h for a player the hub vouches for when the sender is one it does
//! not ([`crate::chat_ban`]), and for SJK staff Delete, Lift chat ban and Mute at the
//! hub. Resting the pointer on a
//! name, in the chat or the window, shows that player's sender card with Mute or
//! Unmute ([`crate::sender_card`], "Muting a player"). GIF beside Send opens the GIF
//! picker over the messages ([`gif_picker`]): favourites, GIPHY's search and the GIFs
//! seen in the chat; a chosen message's GIF can be made a favourite. Search needs the
//! player's own GIPHY key: without one the key card says how to get it and takes it.
//!
//! Opened by the main page's docked chat (Open chat), the `sjkchat` command or the
//! in-game SJK menu. Like the Staff page it lives in the console and has the SJK UI's
//! look ([`view`]). The field has the keyboard when the page opens: typing goes to
//! it, Enter sends, Up goes to the newest message; Up and Down move through the
//! messages, Page Up and Page Down scroll, Tab walks every control, Escape goes back
//! (or closes the GIF picker first).
