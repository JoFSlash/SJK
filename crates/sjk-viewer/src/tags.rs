//! Tags, SJK's toy (`toy_tag`; Sol's idea, 27/10/2026): a player sticks a premade
//! picture on the wall or floor they look at, as TF2's sprays, and every SJK player on
//! the same map sees it there (`docs/client.md`, Tag).
//!
//! - **The tags** are unlocks of the hub (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Unlocks"): [`CATALOGUE`] here,
//!   the same list there. Three are free to everyone ([`Tag::free`]); the others drop
//!   from holocrons, each with a tier as shaders have. Sol picks every one: there are
//!   no uploads (his decision, 27/10/2026); new tags come from rounds on Discord.
//! - **Choosing:** [`CVAR`] holds the chosen tag (the Collection's Tags tab sets it);
//!   one the player does not hold is not stuck.
//! - **Sticking:** [`COMMAND`] traces the crosshair [`REACH`] units into the world and
//!   sticks the chosen tag where it lands, upright on a wall and facing the player on a
//!   floor ([`spin_for`]); `toy_tag clear` takes it off. One tag a player: a new one
//!   replaces the last. At most one every [`GAP`].
//! - **Others:** the tag travels in the player's look (`looks.rs`, `PROTOCOL.md`,
//!   "Looks"), so players who come later see it too. It stays until the player sticks
//!   another, clears it, changes map or server, or leaves. [`SHOW_CVAR`] 0 hides other
//!   players' tags on this PC; a muted or blocked player's never show.
//!
//! - **Finishes and cards** (31/10/2026, Sol's decisions): a tag a holocron drops comes
//!   Holo now and then and Solar rarely, and a tag is stuck in a finish the player holds a
//!   copy in ([`FINISH_CVAR`], [`Held`]); the credits cards they hold stick as tags too,
//!   their picture as a sticker ([`is_card_id`]). Both need a hub that lists `tag_cards`
//!   in profiles ([`Held::of`]); an older hub refuses them, so they are not offered there.
//!
//! - **Collections** (08/11/2026, Sol's decision): every tag belongs to one of
//!   [`COLLECTIONS`], Alpha for SJK's own and Community for those players drew (picked
//!   from #tag-proposals). A collection is a label: the Tags tab lists each under its own
//!   heading and the tag's card names it; it changes nothing in drops (unlike a
//!   blade's edition, `editions.rs`), so the hub does not know it.
//!
//! The pictures are art in the hub's `sjk_tags` pack (`gfx/tags/<id>.png`) and, for a
//! card, its picture in the card packs; the client projects a tag onto the world as a
//! lasting decal of its own (`decal_store.rs`, [`crate::decal_store::DecalStore::set_tag`])
//! and draws it at the picture's full size with its finish (`tag_render.rs`).
