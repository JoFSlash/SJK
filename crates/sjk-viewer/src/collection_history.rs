//! The Collection's History tab (31/10/2026, Sol: "a general inventory history"): what came
//! to the player, what they opened and what it held, the credits and kyber shards they
//! gained and spent, the mystery boxes they opened and the trades they finished, newest
//! first, as the hub keeps it (`GET /v1/history`, [`sjk_identity::history`]).
//!
//! A row is one line in a sentence, a chip of its kind in its tier's colour, what it
//! changed in credits and shards (gains green, spends red) and when, in this PC's time.
//! Consecutive openings of one second (an "Open all") make one row, and so do holocrons
//! that came in one second the same way: Enter or a click opens it on its lines. A row of
//! chips filters what was read, client-side. The tab reads the newest page each time it is
//! shown; Load older, at the end of the list, the next while the hub has more.
//!
//! The rows' words are made once for what was read, the filter and the rows opened
//! ([`History::follow`]), not each frame.
