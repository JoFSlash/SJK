//! Which of the SJK team's announcements the chat has shown (`docs/hub-chat.md`,
//! "Announcements and reward rounds"): `announcements_seen.txt` in the settings folder,
//! beside `identity.key`, as `holocrons_seen.txt` is kept. Announcement numbers at the hub
//! only rise, so the file keeps the highest one shown; one with a higher number is new.
//! The file names the key it belongs to, so a new identity sees its own. With no file for
//! the key (a new install, a new PC) only the newest announcement shows, so a fresh install
//! is not flooded.
