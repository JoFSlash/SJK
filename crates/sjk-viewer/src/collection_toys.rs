//! a row to each on the left (Sol's pick of 25/10/2026, the Collection revamp's canvas):
//! its picture, its name and a line of what it does, the key bound to it and its own

//! model, where its key is bound without the console (a click or K, then the key). The
//! holocron floats lit by the model while it is chosen.
