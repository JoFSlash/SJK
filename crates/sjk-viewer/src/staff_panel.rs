//! The Staff page: for a player the hub's operator made staff, the SJK team's tools
//! in the game (`docs/identity.md`, "Staff"): find a player, then, on the chosen
//! player's tabs, verify them and moderate their picture and SJK chat (Overview), give
//! or take back their medals and unlockables (Medals and unlocks), their holocrons,
//! credits and kyber shards (Holocrons and credits), clear their achievements, list
//! their keys and unlink one or merge another player into them (a player who reset
//! their key), and ask them for their game's logs; two more tabs read every player's
//! crash reports and the SJK chat bans in force, with Lift. Every action is a
//! request signed by the player's own key (`sjk_identity::StaffRequest`,
//! `sjk_identity::StaffQuery`); the hub refuses it from any other key, and the page
//! only opens for a key whose profile says staff.
//!
//! Opened by the Profile page's Staff tools button or the `staff` command. Like the
//! Profile page it lives in the console and has the SJK UI's look ([`view`]). Tab
//! and Shift+Tab walk every control; Enter or Space works the one focused; the
//! search pill, the note and the merge field take typing; Up and Down move through the
//! players found; Escape goes back (or lets go of a merge being confirmed or picked).
