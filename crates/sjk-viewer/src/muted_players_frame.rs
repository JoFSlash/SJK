//! The per-frame hook of muting (`muted_players.rs`): read the mute list once, carry
//! out a mute the chat's profile card asked for, and keep the muted slots of the
//! server being played in step with the list, the hub's claims and the server's
//! players. Each frame costs a few comparisons; the slots are worked out again only
//! when one of those changed. Their looks (blade skin, holocron) go at once
//! (`looks.rs`); the models, sabers and sounds follow in
//! [`GpuState::refresh_muted_models`].
