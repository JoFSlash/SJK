//! The Holocrons page (`docs/holocrons.md`, "The Holocrons tab"): the player's holocrons
//! on the SJK UI's Profile screen as its Holocrons tab ([`crate::profile_hub`]), and, with
//! the classic menus, opened by the Profile page's See holocrons or the `holocrons`
//! command. Like the Unlockables page it lives in the console and has the SJK UI's look
//! in every menu style ([`view`]).
//!
//! Left, the page leaves the world clear for one 3D holocron
//! ([`crate::holocrons::stage`]) wearing the look of the tier chosen; right, the four
//! tiers in a list (picture, name in the tier's colour, how many are held, the odds of a
//! drop), what the chosen tier is, how long to the next holocron, and the newest ten. A
//! tier held none of shows dimmed, never hidden. Under the holocron, Open opens the
//! oldest of the tier chosen and Open all up to twenty, in a ceremony over the page
//! ([`opening`]): each brings a sealed card and credits (`docs/cards.md`). Loot table (or
//! L) shows the odds of everything a holocron brings over the page ([`loot`]); Shop (or S)
//! shows the Collection's Forge on its Shop (since 21/10/2026: the shop was an overlay of
//! this page before). The player's credits and kyber shards stand at the panel's top right.
//!
//! Up and Down (or Left and Right, or the mouse wheel) choose a tier, Tab and Shift+Tab
//! walk them round, 1 to 4 and Home and End jump, Enter opens one, A opens all, L shows
//! the loot table, Escape goes back; a click on a tier chooses it. Open all asks first
//! when more than one would open ([`ask_all`]). The hub's counts and list are read twice a
//! second ([`Data::read`]), never per frame; while the ceremony waits for the hub its
//! answer is looked for every frame.
