//! Achievements: milestones of the player's own play, shown on the Profile page's
//! board (`docs/identity.md`, "Achievements"). Like medals they grant nothing.
//!
//! Most are counted here, from what the client sees in its matches on servers
//! ([`tracker`]): players defeated, duels won, flags captured, maps and servers played,
//! time played. The counts are kept in `achievements.json` in the settings folder, so
//! they work with the identity off, and are sent to the SJK hub with it on, which keeps
//! them with the player's profile (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Achievements"). A few the hub counts
//! itself, from what the player did there (a bio, bug reports, world notes, medals).
//!
//! The hub cannot see a match, so what the client counts is the player's own record:
//! the hub bounds how fast each count may rise, nothing more. With a hub it has the
//! last word all the same: one the client counts that reached its goal here waits for
//! the hub to unlock it (and grant its kyber crystal) before it is announced
//! ([`Standing::waiting`]); without one it unlocks here, with no crystal. Adding an achievement is
//! one entry in [`ALL`] and the same id in the hub's catalogue.
//!
//! A hidden achievement ([`Kind::hidden`]) shows as a secret until it is unlocked; a
//! retired one ([`Kind::retired`]) can no longer be earned and shows only to those who
//! hold it ([`Standing::listed`]).
