//! A thrown monitor's flight: the old CRT as a solid of eight corners held by sticks
//! between every two of them (Verlet integration, as the Ragdoll's body,
//! [`crate::ragdoll`]), so that it tumbles, bounces off the world, topples over an edge
//! and comes to rest on a face.
//!
//! Every SJK client that hears of a throw runs this same simulation from the same
//! [`Throw`], in fixed steps of [`STEP_MS`] game server milliseconds from the throw's
//! moment, as the Ragdoll does: plain arithmetic from whole numbers, so every client puts
//! the monitor in the same place. A monitor that strikes a body is bounced back at that
//! step ([`Deflect`]), on every client alike; one heard of late runs again from its throw.
