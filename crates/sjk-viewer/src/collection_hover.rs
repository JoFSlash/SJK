//! The Collection's hover cards (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, "Hover cards"): resting the pointer on
//! a medal, an achievement, a shader, a toy or a card shows beside it what it is, how it
//! is obtained and where the player stands with it ([`crate::menu::sjk::hover`]). The
//! words come from the same tables as the rest of the page: a medal's
//! [`crate::medals::Medal::how_to_get`], an achievement's goal, a blade skin's
//! `how_to_get` ([`crate::unlockables`]), a card's odds ([`crate::cards::loot`]).
