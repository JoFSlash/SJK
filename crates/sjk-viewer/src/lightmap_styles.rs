//! Light styles folded into a map's lightmaps as it loads.

//! Every switchable or animated light q3map2 baked into a style of its own is added
//! over the surfaces' own lightmaps at full strength, as the cgame shows a style the
//! server gave no pattern (`sjk_bsp::Bsp::compose_light_styles`). Without it a map lit
//! mostly by such lights, like JoF Shuttle with its `mainlights`, `left` and `right`
//! groups, drew almost black. While a game runs, the world's renderer follows the
//! server's `CS_LIGHT_STYLES` (`world_light_styles.rs`).
