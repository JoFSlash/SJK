//! Mystery boxes (Sol's idea, 27/10/2026; `docs/mystery-boxes.md`): boxes SJK's creator
//! places on maps through the hub, which any SJK player opens for credits with `+use`.
//! The hub keeps where they stand, takes the price and rolls what is inside
//! (`sjk_identity::mystery_box`); this module draws the boxes standing on the loaded map
//! file, asks to open the one the player faces, and plays the opening: a music box tune
//! while things roll over the box, slowing to a stop on what came out, which then floats
//! there until the opener takes it with `+use` (or by itself after [`HOLD`]). Other
//! players' openings come through the hub's toy event. No game server knows of them: a
//! box is drawn by SJK clients only and has no collision.
