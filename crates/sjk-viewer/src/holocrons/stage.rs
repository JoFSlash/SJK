//! The Holocrons tab's 3D holocron ([`crate::console::holocrons_panel`]): one holocron floating in
//! the world behind the tab, over the left of the screen where the page leaves it clear.
//! It turns and bobs as Illuminate's does ([`crate::illuminate`]) and is the holocron of
//! the tier chosen in the list, each tier an object of its own (`docs/holocrons.md`, "The
//! four holocrons"): the Jedi cube, the Great Holocron with its turning halo, the Sith
//! pyramid with its floating cap and eye, the gold engram with its breathing plates,
//! glowing seams and core and its sparks, and a point light in the tier's colour. It also draws the four kyber
//! crystals (`kyber_<tier>`: a crystal in its sheath, tumbling rings, motes), asked by the
//! hub's tier id ([`Request::of`]). For a tier the player holds none of
//! it is the locked look: the same shape drained and dark, its parts at rest, with a faint
//! light (padlock-like dimming; it is never hidden, so every tier can be seen).
//!
//! It is an ordinary object of the world pass: an instance of each part's model in
//! `object_groups`, loaded with the map's other rigid models ([`models`]), and a point
//! light, so the menu map's stage (the Character tab's) is not needed: it floats before
//! the backdrop camera ([`place`]), which the tab asks to park on its own shot
//! ([`crate::menu_backdrop::Shot::Holocrons`]). Over a match (the game menu's Collection)
//! it floats before the game's camera, the third-person one too: it is placed from the
//! view the frame renders (`GpuState::frame_view`), with that view's own field.
//!
//! A form is a model per part ([`FORMS`], written with the models by
//! `scripts/holocron_assets.py`): its body, and each part that moves against it, posed
//! from the time ([`Part::pose`]). The locked look has models of its own because a
//! surface's shader is named by its model file.
//!
//! Changing the tier shrinks the old look away and grows the new one ([`Stage`]); the
//! frame allocates nothing.
