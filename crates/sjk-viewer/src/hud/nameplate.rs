//! MMO-style nameplates over players (and, optionally, NPCs).
//!
//! Players choose how a plate looks (`cg_nameplateStyle`, [`Style`], 31/10/2026): the
//! holo frame, the capsule or the classic plate, the three designs SJK has had. All
//! three share what a plate says; only its shape differs.
//!
//! - **Holo frame** (the default, design C, Sol's pick of 28/10/2026): a hexagon holding
//!   the player's picture (their SJK hub picture, else their initial on their colour, or
//!   for a player without SJK their model's head icon) over the left end of a plate with
//!   a cut corner, which holds their name. The frame's colour tells an SJK player (holo
//!   blue) from one without SJK (grey), a team or a duel; a sharer's plate has a gold
//!   corner. Closer, a sharer's health, shield and Force bars fade in under the name (a
//!   dotted line without them); far away the plate fades and a small hexagon and the
//!   name stay over a hairline.
//! - **Capsule** ([`capsule`], design E of 28/10/2026): a pill holding the picture and
//!   the name, with a sharer's bars on a tray tucked under it.
//! - **Classic** ([`classic`], the plates before 28/10/2026): the name over a framed plate
//!   of rounded bars, gold-edged for a sharer, grey bars for a player who does not share.
//!
//! No weapon since 28/10/2026. The Force powers a player has on stand over the plate in
//! square cells. A dark name (black `^0`) is edged in a light halo so it reads on the
//! see-through plate ([`crate::text::CodePalette::Haloed`]).
//! Names come from the chat roster and are drawn in the classic HUD font with
//! their colour codes; the layout maths is in [`super::nameplate_math`]. A sharer's
//! health and shield are estimated between the values they share, once per snapshot,
//! in [`super::vitals_estimate`], each as a range whose uncertainty the bar shows as a
//! grey haze; their Force is the last value they shared, not estimated (17/10/2026). The plain
//! TaystJK names stay in [`super::identification`] (`cg_drawPlayerNames`); a
//! nameplate replaces them.
