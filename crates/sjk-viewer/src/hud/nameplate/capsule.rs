//! The capsule nameplate (design E, 28/10/2026; `cg_nameplateStyle 1` since 31/10/2026):
//! a pill holding the player's picture (round), their name with its mark after it and,
//! at its right end in a duel, the duel badge. A sharer's bars stand on a tray tucked
//! under it; a player who does not share has the capsule alone. Team games tint the
//! pill in the team's colour made deep, a sharer's edge is gold, and far away the pill
//! fades leaving the picture and the name.
