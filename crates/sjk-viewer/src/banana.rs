//! The Banana peel, SJK's meme toy (`toy_banana`; Kushina's idea, approved by Sol on
//! 29/10/2026): a player with the toy on drops banana peels on the floor
//! (`banana_drop`), and a player who has it on too and walks onto one slips: a cartoon
//! slip sound, and their body goes limp as a ragdoll, its feet swept along the way they
//! walked and up.
//!
//! - **Opt-in:** the switch (`toy_banana`, the Collection's Toys tab, the quick wheel)
//!   is both the right to drop peels and the consent to slip on them; it stays as last
//!   switched ([`crate::toy_saved::BANANA_CVAR`]). A player without it walks over peels.
//!   Nobody drops or slips while dead, spectating, in a duel, with the flag, limp,
//!   hacked, held by the server or in a vehicle (the Ragdoll's rules,
//!   [`crate::ragdoll::Ragdoll::strikable`]).
//! - **The drop:** at the player's feet, a little ahead ([`DROP_REACH`]), or tossed
//!   [`TOSS_REACH`] ahead the way they move when they move; it flies from the hand for
//!   [`FLIGHT_MS`], tumbling, and lands on the floor below, lying flat on it. Not within
//!   [`SPAWN_CLEARANCE`] of a spawn point ([`SPAWN_CLASSES`]), nor where no floor is near.
//! - **The slip** is decided by the slipping player's client alone, as the Monitor's
//!   hit is: on the ground, moving at least [`MIN_SLIP_SPEED`], their feet within
//!   [`SLIP_RADIUS`] of a peel they came at (one that landed under them waits until
//!   they have stepped off it, [`ARM_RADIUS`]; their own waits [`OWN_SAFE_MS`] more).
//!   The body falls and takes a blow at a foot ([`slip_push`]); the peel is used up for
//!   everyone. They get up as from any fall the Ragdoll did not start by itself: a jump,
//!   an attack or a taunt, or by themselves once the body has lain still.
//! - **Limits:** [`PER_PLAYER`] peels down a player (a new one takes the oldest's place),
//!   each for [`LIFETIME_MS`], one every [`COOLDOWN`]; all go with a new map, another
//!   server, or when their dropper turns the toy off or leaves.
//! - **Unseen:** in a duel (the player's own or the one they follow, and on Duel and
//!   Power Duel servers) no peel is drawn or heard; [`SHOW_CVAR`] at 0 hides every peel
//!   and its sounds in the world, everywhere. Neither changes who may slip: the switch
//!   does, as for the Monitor.
//!
//! No game server knows of it, and nothing goes through the hub's looks: every SJK
//! client on the server learns of a peel from its dropper's client through the toy relay
//! (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Toy relay"), which tells each SJK player in turn, the nearest first,
//! and the ones who come later: [`Event::Drop`], `drop_<number>_<moment>_<x>_<y>_<z>_
//! <dx>_<dy>_<dz>_<yaw>`. The slipping player's client tells every one that the peel is
//! gone (`slip_<dropper>_<number>`), and the dropper's that all theirs are, when the toy
//! goes off (`clear`). The fall itself travels as the Ragdoll's, its blow naming the
//! dropper and no monitor ([`crate::ragdoll::UNTHROWN`]). Players on stock clients see
//! nothing.
