//! What the toys say when the player switches them, and `toy_help` (Blep's idea, Sol's
//! #ideas recap 29/10/2026; Creyon's test, 29/10/2026: short, on and off told apart by
//! colour, the explanations in a command of their own).
//!
//! - **Switched:** every toy with an on/off switch says its name and **ON** in green or
//!   **OFF** in red on the centre of the screen ([`switched`]): Illuminate, the cardboard
//!   box, Order 66, the Hax, the Drone, the Monitor, Box hunt and the Banana peel, and
//!   the Boombox put away (its start names the track instead). Said only for the
//!   player's own switch (a
//!   bind, the quick wheel, the Collection's Toys tab); a toy restored at start
//!   (`toy_saved`) or taken off by the game (a box lifted) says nothing.
//! - **`toy_help`** ([`COMMAND`]) lists every toy in the console, its name in yellow and,
//!   in white, what it does and how ([`help_lines`]).

/// The console command listing every toy.
