//! The Hax, SJK's meme toy (`toy_hax`; Sol's idea, 21/10/2026): a player who has it on
//! holds `+use` on another player who has it on, the siege hack bar fills with its
//! sound, and once the hack is done the hacker steers the hacked player for a few
//! seconds (running, walking, jumping, crouching, swinging), watching them from behind.
//!
//! No game server knows of it, and no client can move another player: the hacked
//! player's own client plays the hacker's controls as its own user commands. The hacker's
//! client sends them, many times a second, through the SJK hub's toy relay
//! (`player_identity::relay_toy_event`, `PROTOCOL.md` "Toy relay"), which hands them to
//! the hacked player's client at once. The toy itself travels as a toy in the player's
//! look (`looks.rs`, [`TOY`]), so the hacker's client knows who may be hacked.
//!
//! The exchange, every event from one player to the other (the relay's `target`):
//!
//! - hacker: `hack_<moment>` (a hack began, done at the game server's `moment`), `stop`
//!   (it ended early), `seize` (it is done), then `in_<frame>` ([`Frame`]) while in control;
//! - hacked player: `taken_<until>` (in control until the game server's `until`),
//!   `refused_<why>` ([`Refusal`]), or `stop` (broke free: the toy turned off, died).
//!
//! Only the hacked player's client decides: it takes a seize only from a player the game
//! shows under the name they claimed, not blocked here, who has the toy out, while its own
//! toy is on and its player plays (not in a duel, not carrying a flag, not away, not
//! hacked in the last [`IMMUNE_MS`]). A hack does not begin on a player who is typing in
//! the chat (their talk balloon, `EF_TALK`) or away as the scoreboard marks them. Turning the toy off frees the player at once. Controls are
//! limited to [`CONTROL_BUTTONS`] and the movement keys: no Force power, weapon change,
//! chat or command goes through. The hacker's own player stands still meanwhile, open to
//! attack. Players on stock clients see a player who stands still and one who moves.
//!
//! A trap (Sol's idea, 23/10/2026): a player with [`TRAP_CVAR`] on answers a seize with
//! `trap_<moment>` instead. Nobody is steered: both players read "IT'S A TRAP!" over
//! Order 66's beeps, and at the moment, two seconds on, both clients send `kill` and
//! both players blow up as Order 66's do (`order66::order66_blow_up`). The hacked player
//! tells everyone else through a feed toy event (`trap_<moment>`, to the hacker), so
//! their clients blow the two up too; the two seconds give it time to arrive. With
//! [`AWAY_CVAR`] on as well, the trap holds while the player is away: their look shows
//! [`AWAY_TOY`], so hackers' clients let a hack begin on them though they are away.
//!
//! A hacked player is wreathed in a green digital rain ([`GLYPHS`]) while steered: on
//! their own screen and the hacker's at once, and on every other SJK client of the server
//! through a feed toy event the hacked player sends (`hacked_<until>`, then `freed` when
//! they break free sooner), which may come a second or two late.
//!
//! The hack bar is the siege one (`hud/hack_bar.rs`, the stock `gfx/mp/c_icon_tech`),
//! shown to both, and the loop is the stock hacking sound ([`HACK_SOUND`]); the seize and
//! the release play the stock mind trick's ([`SEIZE_SOUND`], [`RELEASE_SOUND`]).
