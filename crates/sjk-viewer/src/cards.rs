//! Cards and credits (`docs/cards.md`): what opening a holocron brings. The SJK hub rolls
//! a card's rarity, finish and edition and the credits, and keeps them; the client shows
//! them. Until the first set of cards is out every card is *sealed*: its rarity, finish
//! and edition are known, its face is chosen when it is revealed.
//!
//! This is the one place that says which rarities, finishes and editions the client knows
//! and how each reads ([`RARITIES`], [`FINISHES`], [`edition_name`]), what a holocron of
//! each tier holds ([`CREDITS`], [`inside`]) and how a profile's cards read ([`stacks`]).
//! An id the client does not know is left out.
