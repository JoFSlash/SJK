//! Players' models loaded off the render thread. A player who joins or changes model
//! (a `CS_PLAYERS` change, a forced-model or mute change) used to load and upload the
//! whole model inside one frame: the `.glm`, its skin and animation sounds read and
//! parsed, its textures decoded, then uploaded, which players felt as a stutter. Now a
//! worker reads and parses the model, builds its mesh and decodes its textures
//! ([`crate::world_materials::warm_entity_materials`]); the render thread only uploads
//! it: one texture a frame, as models a server names and NPCs do, then its materials and
//! geometry. All its textures in one frame cost 255 to 425 ms for an HD player model on
//! Slash's built-in GPU (`zzzpiza/original`, 24/10/2026). The worker also builds the
//! model's body copy, which a later frame puts in the body pool sharing the model's
//! materials: a player's first death with a model built it on the render thread, the
//! 35 to 310 ms hitches of the same log at kills (`corpse_actors.rs`). Meanwhile the slot keeps the model it had, or shows the
//! stand-in actor until the first one is in (`actor_world_submission.rs`). A model whose
//! materials need pipelines the map had not compiled waits for another worker to compile
//! them (`world_pipeline_jobs.rs`) before it is put on its player: compiled on the render
//! thread they cost up to 85 ms.
