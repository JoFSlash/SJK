//! The cardboard box, SJK's own toy (`toy_box`; Sol's idea, 16/10/2026): a shipping
//! carton the player hides in, Metal Gear style. While it is on, the player crouches
//! in it (the user commands hold crouch, [`CardboardBox::shape_command`]) and its
//! music plays on them. No game server knows of it: it travels through the SJK hub as
//! a toy in the player's look (`looks.rs`, [`TOY`]), so other SJK players on the server
//! see the box over that player and hear the music; players on stock clients see a
//! crouching player.
//!
//! Another SJK player who presses `+use` facing a boxed player within reach lifts the
//! box ([`pick_target`]): the "spotted" sound plays, the box goes at once on the
//! lifter's screen, and the hub relays a toy event ([`EVENT_SPOTTED`]) on which the
//! boxed player's client takes it off (and tells its look) and every other SJK client
//! hides it and plays the sound. A player who dies in the box plays its death sound
//! where they fell, on every SJK client that sees it; the box is lost with the life
//! (off at the respawn). It is out at every start, like Illuminate.
//!
//! A box put on plays its sound ([`EQUIP`]). A box taken off or lifted, its player
//! still standing, tips over on its side ([`Fallen`]: away from the lifter, or the way
//! its player faced), lands with a thud ([`DROP`]), lies there a few seconds and goes.
//!
//! The carton's model, picture, shader and icon are bundled ([`FILES`], made by
//! `scripts/cardboard_box_assets.py`) and mounted below all game data, so a PK3 with
//! the same paths replaces them. The sounds ([`MUSIC`], [`EQUIP`], [`SPOTTED`],
//! [`DROP`], [`DEATH`]) are game paths that SJK does not ship; where they are missing
//! nothing plays.
