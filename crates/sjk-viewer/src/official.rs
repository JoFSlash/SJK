//! The SJK team's announcements and contributor reward rounds in the client
//! (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "Announcements and reward rounds"; the hub's side is
//! `PROTOCOL.md`, "Announcements" and "Reward rounds").
//!
//! | piece | module |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the chat lines' words and marks | [`words`] |
//! | `announcements_seen.txt` | [`seen`] |
//! | the windows: an announcement, the rounds, a claim, the composer | [`window`] |
//!
//! Announcements show in the SJK chat only, never in a game server's chat. The identity
//! service reads them at the registration and every 30 minutes, and the feed relays new
//! ones as they come; those not shown yet (at most the newest three, or only the newest
//! with no seen file) go to the end of the SJK chat once its first answer came
//! ([`crate::GpuState::follow_official`]). A click on a line in the docked chat or the chat
//! page opens it in full ([`request`]); the game's chat names the `announcement` command.
//! A command closes the console as it opens the window; a click on the chat page keeps
//! it under the window. While the window shows, the cursor is free and it takes every key.
//!
//! A reward round's line opens the round list (or `rewards`). A reward waiting for the
//! player opens the claim window as the medal pop-up does: on the main menu, or when the
//! game menu opens in a match, never over play; a match gets an unlock card once per
//! reward. Claim asks the hub; the gift holocrons it gives then arrive through the
//! holocron pop-up, and the window shows the next reward or closes. Later puts it away
//! until the next menu.
//!
//! The creator writes announcements with `announce` (the hub refuses anyone else).
//! `debug_announce` and `debug_reward` rehearse the lines and windows offline: nothing is
//! sent and nothing is counted as seen.
