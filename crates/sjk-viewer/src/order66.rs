//! Order 66, SJK's meme toy (`toy_order66`; Sol's idea, 17/10/2026): every player who
//! has it on dies at once, blown apart, when one of them executes the order (`order66`).
//! No game server knows of it. The toy travels through the SJK hub as a toy in the
//! player's look (`looks.rs`, [`TOY`]), and the order as a toy event
//! ([`EVENT_PREFIX`] and the moment it falls due, in the game server's time).
//!
//! The order falls due [`COUNTDOWN_MS`] after it is given, on the game server's clock,
//! which every client on the server shares through its snapshots: each client counts
//! down on the centre of the screen and, at that moment, sends the stock `kill` command
//! for its own player, so the deaths land together whatever each client's way to the
//! hub took. A client sends it only while its own toy is on and its player plays: not
//! spectating, not in a duel, not carrying a flag ([`spared`]). One order counts per
//! server every [`COOLDOWN_MS`]: every client drops one that comes sooner, so a sender
//! cannot keep a server in a kill loop.
//!
//! A player who has the toy on and dies in the order's window ([`BLAST_EARLY_MS`] before
//! to [`BLAST_WINDOW_MS`] after) blows up on every SJK client that sees it: the thermal
//! detonator's explosion ([`EXPLOSION`]), and the body flies apart in six pieces (head,
//! arms, legs and trunk, `dismember.rs`'s limb meshes, [`GpuState::blow_apart`]) that
//! bounce off the world, smoke and sink away. Where dismemberment is off
//! (`cg_dismember 0`) the body bursts into confetti instead ([`CONFETTI`]). Players on
//! stock clients see an ordinary suicide.
