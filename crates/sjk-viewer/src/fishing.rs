//! Fishing, SJK's own toy (`toy_fishing`; Sanji's idea from #ideas, 29/10/2026, phase 1
//! of Slash's design): facing water, the player props a rod beside them, sets a bucket at
//! their feet and casts. Every 20 to 60 seconds the float bobs under (a bite) and `+use`
//! within about a second hooks the catch: nothing, junk or a fish, counted in the
//! player's fish log (`fishing_log.txt`). Moving, jumping, attacking, taking damage or
//! dying puts the rod away.
//!
//! An Echo (holocron) the hub drops while the player fishes does not pop up at once: it
//! bites as an Echo bite ([`Bite::echo`], its own sound, a longer window) and hooking it
//! brings its card. Missed twice, or the rod put away, the card comes as it always does.
//! Phase 1 changes nothing at the hub: the Echo is the player's from the moment the hub
//! drops it, by the usual clock and caps, and the fish are a local log, no credits, no
//! shards. So fishing earns nothing that playing does not.
//!
//! No game server knows of it: it travels through the SJK hub as a toy in the player's
//! look ([`TOY`]), so other SJK players see the rod, the bucket and the float (where
//! their client finds water in front of that player); players on stock clients see a
//! player standing still.
//!
//! The models, picture, shader and icon are bundled ([`FILES`], made by
//! `scripts/fishing_assets.py`) and mounted below all game data. The sounds are retail
//! game paths.
