//! The Ragdoll, SJK's meme toy (`toy_ragdoll`; Sol's idea, 23/10/2026): the player's
//! body goes limp and falls where physics takes it, as in the sandbox games, though the
//! player is not dead; `toy_ragdoll` again gets them up.
//!
//! No game server knows of it. The body is the client's: a simulated humanoid
//! ([`body`]) drawn with the player's own model ([`skin`]), the camera following it
//! from behind (the mouse turns it). Every SJK client on the server shows the same fall
//! without any pose being sent: the faller's client relays one start event to every SJK
//! player there (`fall_<moment>_<origin>_<speed>_<yaw>`, the toy relay, `PROTOCOL.md`
//! "Toy relay"), and each runs the same simulation from it in fixed steps of the game
//! server's clock, fast-forwarding a fall it hears late. Getting up relays `up_<moment>`.
//! A player who comes onto the server (or whose SJK client starts) during a fall is told
//! of it too.
//!
//! The player's real body stays on the game server: while limp, the client walks it to
//! where the ragdoll lies (its own user commands, as the Hax's steering), so that the
//! player gets up there. Every SJK client draws the ragdoll in its place; players on
//! stock clients see a player walking about. A limp player sends no button, so cannot
//! attack, and gets up at once when hurt, dead, spectating, in a duel or carrying a flag
//! ([`crate::order66::spared`]), or when the server holds their view (a kiss, a grapple,
//! a kick: [`crate::held_view`]); nobody falls in one of those either.
//!
//! The fall is heard: an original flatline, the toy's own ([`FLATLINE`], made by
//! `scripts/ragdoll_assets.py`; a PK3 with the same path replaces it), at the body, and
//! every part's knocks and scrapes on the world, flesh and the surface's material
//! ([`sounds`]). Lifts, doors and trains carry and push the body ([`scene`]).
//!
//! A body can be struck (the Monitor toy, [`crate::monitor`], 26/10/2026): the struck
//! player's client gives its body a [`body::Strike`] (falling first if standing) and
//! relays it after the fall, `hit_<fall moment>_<step>_<joint>_<push>_<by>`, `by` naming
//! the monitor (its thrower's slot, its number and its step, so that every client bounces
//! it off the body alike). A client that hears of a blow after its step ran the body on
//! runs it again from its start with it ([`body::Body::rerun`]). A fall a monitor began
//! ends by itself once the body has lain still a while ([`REST_UP`]). A slip on a banana
//! peel ([`crate::banana`], 29/10/2026) is such a blow too, at a foot, naming the peel's
//! dropper and no monitor ([`UNTHROWN`]).
