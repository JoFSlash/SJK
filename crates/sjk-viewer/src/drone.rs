//! The Drone, SJK's toy (`toy_drone`; Sol's idea, 24/10/2026, from Slash's Peek work in
//! #199): the free camera and Peek fly a little training remote, the game's own seeker
//! ball ([`MODEL`]), which every other SJK player on the server sees with the pilot's
//! name over it.
//!
//! - `freecam` (`free_camera.rs`) flies the drone: it is where the camera is.
//! - `peek` (`peek.rs`) sends the drone to a player: it hovers behind them, where the
//!   peeking camera stands ([`crate::peek::behind`]). A player may be peeked only while
//!   their own Drone switch is on (the consent: their look shows [`TOY`]); turning it off
//!   sends any drone away at once (`away`, relayed to the pilot, as is an answer to a
//!   drone that comes while it is off). The watched player does not see the drones
//!   behind them; a line at the top of their screen names who watches.
//! - A player in a private duel does not see the drones of pilots outside it
//!   ([`duel_hidden_pilots`]), unless `cg_duelHideOthers` is 0.
//!
//! The switch (`toy_drone`, the Collection's Toys tab, the quick wheel) is only that
//! consent; `freecam` and `peek` keep their commands and binds, and fly the drone
//! whether it is on or not. It stays as last switched ([`crate::toy_saved::DRONE_CVAR`]).
//!
//! No game server knows of it. The pilot's client tells every other SJK player on the
//! server where the drone is through the SJK hub's toy relay (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Toy
//! relay"): `fly_<x>_<y>_<z>_<yaw>` while the camera flies, `peek_<slot>` while it
//! watches a player, `land` when it is put away. One event goes every [`SEND_GAP`], to
//! the players in turn, each one the drone's latest place or a repeat every
//! [`KEEPALIVE`]; a drone not heard of for [`LOST`] goes. Each client glides the drones
//! it shows between the places it hears of. Players on stock clients see nothing.
