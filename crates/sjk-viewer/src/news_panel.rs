//! The News panel (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, "News panel"; Sol's request, 31/10/2026: the
//! what's-new card and the announcements "are kinda the same", one panel for both, with
//! working switches, pictures and links). It replaced the what's-new card and the
//! announcement card: one SJK pop-up over the darkened screen, the same look in every
//! menu style, on the 16:9 frame.
//!
//! - **Left, the entries** newest first: "Settings to review" when an update asks for
//!   it, the SJK team's announcements (the hub's newest ten) and the recaps of the
//!   recent releases (`CHANGELOG.md`). A release's announcement goes on its release's
//!   entry, above the recap. An entry the player has not read wears a gold dot.
//! - **Right, the entry in full:** its kicker and date, its title, then its text:
//!   recap headings with their icons over their sentences, paragraphs and gold bullets,
//!   commands and cvars in chips, links (`[Label](target)`, [`crate::ui_links`]),
//!   pictures (`[[image:<id>]]`, [`crate::news_images`]) and switches (`= <cvar>:` in the
//!   changelog, `[[switch:<cvar>]]` in an announcement), which flip the setting at once
//!   and keep the panel up. Up to fill the pane, the wheel and Page Up/Down scroll it.
//!
//! **When it opens on its own** (on the main menu, or over the game menu in a match,
//! never in the middle of play, after the other cards): after an update, on that
//! update's settings to review or its recap (`cl_whatsNewSeen` holds the version whose
//! panel was closed, as the card's did), and when an announcement came that the player
//! has not read (`announcements_seen.txt`, [`crate::official::seen`]). Asked for (the
//! chat line's "Read more", `news`, `whatsnew`, `announcement [n]`) it shows at once,
//! over play too, with the cursor free.
//!
//! The update's bookkeeping is the card's: a new installation writes the marker and
//! shows nothing, a local build no release lists shows nothing, and the settings an
//! update marks `reset` go back to their default once per version ([`RESET_CVAR`]).
