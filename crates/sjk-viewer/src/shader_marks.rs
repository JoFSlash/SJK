//! Collection marks on saber shaders (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, Collection, "Marks"; 29/10/2026,
//! ideas of the players Atrosex and Kushina, extended by Sol): what the Shaders tab, the
//! Forge and the trade picker show on a shader besides its tier.
//!
//! - **Worn:** a blade the player wears: the first saber's (`cg_saberSkin`) or the second
//!   saber's (or the staff's other half's) own choice (`cg_saberSkin2`).
//! - **Favourite** (a star) and **Locked** (a padlock): the player's own marks, kept at the
//!   hub so they follow the player to any PC (`sjk_identity::UnlockMarks`). Favourites are
//!   listed first and a chip shows them alone; the hub refuses to break down or trade a
//!   locked shader, and the client greys those buttons with the reason. Only shown on a hub
//!   whose economy says `marks` ([`sjk_identity::MARKS_ABILITY`]).
//! - **New:** a shader the player holds and has not looked at since they got it. Local, on
//!   this PC: the seen-list [`FILE`] beside `config.cfg`, one shader id a line. With no file
//!   yet, everything already held the first time the hub says what the player holds counts
//!   as seen, so a player never finds every shader marked New. A shader chosen on the
//!   Shaders tab or in the Forge (by the pointer or the keys) is seen once it has stayed
//!   chosen for [`LOOK_MS`] ([`Look`]): sweeping the pointer across the wall sees nothing
//!   (Sol's decision, 29/10/2026); "Mark all seen" sees every one. One the player no longer
//!   holds leaves the list, so it is New again when it comes back.
