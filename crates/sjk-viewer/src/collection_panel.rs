//! The Collection screen (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, Collection): what an SJK player collects,
//! under one row of tabs. Medals (given by the SJK team, hanging from a rail),
//! Achievements (a wall of medallions by category), Shaders (the saber's looks: the
//! stock blade and every blade skin, owned or locked), Toys (the Illuminate holocron)
//! Nameplates (ornaments for the plate over the player's head; none yet) and Cards (the
//! sealed cards opening holocrons brought, and the credits), and since 21/10/2026 the
//! Forge between them (the shop, crafting and breaking shaders down, [`forge`]). Every
//! tab shows its things on the left, each in its place from the start (the ones the
//! player lacks dimmed), and the one chosen up close on the right; on Shaders, Toys and
//! Nameplates that is the player's own model, on the menu map's stage or in a live
//! preview over a match ([`Backstage`]), wearing the shader chosen, a locked one too
//! (only on this screen: nothing is sent).
//!
//! In the SJK UI it is the main page's and the game menu's Collection, a screen of its
//! own ([`crate::profile_hub`]); in the classic menus the `collection`, `achievements`
//! and `unlockables` commands open it on its own. Like the Profile page it lives in the
//! console and has the SJK UI's look in every menu style ([`view`]).
//!
//! Keys: the arrows choose (on Achievements Up and Down move between the categories),
//! Tab and Shift+Tab walk the things, Enter or Space equips or unequips the shader
//! chosen or lights and puts out the Illuminate holocron, Ctrl+Tab changes tab (the
//! switch's, [`crate::profile_hub`]), Escape goes back. The pointer chooses by
//! hovering; a click on a button acts, on a tab shows it.
