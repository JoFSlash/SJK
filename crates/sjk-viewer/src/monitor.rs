//! The Monitor, SJK's meme toy (`toy_monitor`; Sol's idea, 26/10/2026, after the old
//! sandbox-game joke of hurling a big CRT monitor at someone): a player with the toy on
//! throws an old square monitor (`monitor_throw`, [`MODEL`]); one that hits another
//! player who has the toy on too knocks them down as a ragdoll and sends them flying,
//! the way the monitor struck them.
//!
//! - **Opt-in:** the switch (`toy_monitor`, the Collection's Toys tab, the quick wheel)
//!   is both the right to throw and the consent to be hit; it stays as last switched
//!   ([`crate::toy_saved::MONITOR_CVAR`]). A monitor passes through a player without it.
//!   Nobody throws or is hit while dead, spectating, in a duel, with the flag, limp,
//!   hacked or held by the server (as for the Ragdoll), and a throw waits
//!   [`COOLDOWN`] after the last.
//! - **The throw:** from the eyes, the way the player looks, at [`THROW_SPEED`] plus
//!   the thrower's own speed, tumbling end over end. Held (`+monitor_throw`, the key
//!   bindings' Throw monitor), the throw charges while a ring fills round the crosshair
//!   and a tube's hum rises ([`CHARGE_SOUND`]), and goes on the release, up to
//!   [`MAX_THROW_SPEED`] once held [`CHARGE_TIME`]; a charged throw is heard as one
//!   ([`THROW_HARD_SOUND`]) by everyone, from its speed. The monitor is a solid of eight
//!   corners ([`flight`]): it bounces off the world, topples and comes to rest on a
//!   face, and goes [`LINGER`] after.
//! - **The hit:** the struck player's client alone decides it, against its own body (a
//!   standing player's box, or a ragdoll's points): the monitor must come at them
//!   faster than [`MIN_HIT_SPEED`]. Their body falls limp ([`crate::ragdoll`]) and takes
//!   a push at the point the monitor met ([`crate::ragdoll::Strike`]): the monitor's
//!   speed against theirs times [`TRANSFER`], [`LIFT`] upwards, at most [`MAX_LAUNCH`];
//!   a blow off the body's centre turns it. A ragdoll can be struck again where it lies
//!   or flies. The monitor bounces back off the body. The player gets up by themselves
//!   once the body has lain still a little, or with `toy_ragdoll`. The thrower sees a
//!   hit marker on their crosshair and hears [`HIT_SOUND`] when the struck player's
//!   blow reaches them (red for a hard one).
//!
//! - **Busy:** nobody is struck while typing (a key catcher open: the chat, the
//!   console, a menu, the talk balloon's `EF_TALK` for others) or away (alt-tabbed or
//!   idle, or an away tag in their name, as the Hax reads it): a monitor passes through.
//! - **Foreseen:** every SJK client also tries each monitor against the other players
//!   who have the toy on (their look says so) as it sees them, and on a hit knocks
//!   their body down and bounces the monitor at once, as a shooter shows a hit before
//!   the server's word: their own client's word (the `hit_` event) comes a ping or more
//!   later and takes its place, and without it the guess is undone
//!   ([`crate::ragdoll::GUESS_WAIT`]). The thrower's hit marker shows at the guess.
//! - **Screen Saver:** struck by [`saver::HITS`] monitors of others within
//!   [`saver::WINDOW_MS`], the player is untouchable by monitors for
//!   [`saver::LASTS_MS`] and still throws, wrapped in a gold shell ([`saver`]).
//! - **Unseen:** in a duel (the player's own or the one they follow, and on Duel and
//!   Power Duel servers) no monitor is drawn or heard, nor any mark shown; and
//!   [`SHOW_CVAR`] at 0 hides every monitor and its sounds in the world, everywhere (the
//!   player's own throw ring and hit marker stay), nor any Screen Saver's shell. Neither
//!   changes who may be hit: the switch does.
//!
//! No game server knows of it: the player's real body stays where it was and walks to
//! the ragdoll, as for the Ragdoll. Every SJK client on the server sees the same throw:
//! the thrower's client relays `throw_<number>_<moment>_<x>_<y>_<z>_<vx>_<vy>_<vz>`
//! (the toy relay, `PROTOCOL.md`, "Toy relay") to each SJK player in turn, the nearest
//! first, one every [`SEND_GAP`], and each runs the same flight from it in steps of the
//! game server's clock. A hit travels as the Ragdoll's `hit_` event, which names the
//! monitor so that every client bounces it off the body at the same step. Players on
//! stock clients see nothing.
