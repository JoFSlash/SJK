//! The Holocrons tab's opening (`docs/cards.md`, "Opening"): Open (the oldest holocron of
//! the tier chosen) or Open all (up to twenty, the oldest first) asks the hub, and while
//! it answers the tab's 3D holocron glides to the middle of the window and hums
//! ([`super::unseal`]). Then each holocron opened plays its ceremony over the darkened
//! page, one after another:
//!
//! - the holocron spins up, blazes and cracks open in a flash of its tier's colour
//!   ([`super::unseal`]);
//! - out of the flash a strip of what its tier can drop runs past a gold marker and slows
//!   to a stop on the prize, as a loot crate does ([`super::strip`]): a tick a tile, a
//!   colour band under each, the prize lit and the others dimmed once it rests; a card
//!   shows there as its credits, a stack of coins and the amount, with the card tucked
//!   face down in a corner in its rarity's colour (18/10/2026);
//! - it bursts open in its tier's light: rings run out, rays turn, the gem flares and
//!   goes;
//! - a card comes as its pack: the credits' tile rises where the strip stopped, counting
//!   up, then slides aside while the tucked card slides out to the middle, grows and
//!   flips over to face the player in its rarity's colour and its finish's light
//!   ([`crate::cards::look`]), a Holo, Solar or Legendary one in a flourish of its light;
//!   then the kyber shards slide out on the other side and count up (a shader instead of
//!   a card shows its blade, framed in its tier's colour, and what it is; a pile of kyber
//!   shards its crystals and how many);
//! - its words fade up: the card's rarity and finish, its edition, what the finish is,
//!   that it stays sealed until the first set of cards is out, and "1 of 3".
//!
//! Enter, Space, Right or a click skip to the burst, finish the entrance at once, then
//! take Next (Done on the last); Escape ends the ceremony (what was opened is the hub's
//! already). Openings of more than three crack the first holocron, run their strips five
//! at a time and then lay out everything found ([`super::batch`]). A refusal or no answer
//! shows why, and the page reads the hub again. `debug_open` plays made-up openings the same way
//! ([`crate::cards::rehearsal`]).
//!
//! While the ceremony shows the page under it is not drawn: text draws above every shape,
//! so the page's words would show through the dark.
