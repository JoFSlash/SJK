//! Looks (`docs/unlockables.md`, "Receiving"): what each player on the game server
//! wears that SJK draws, the blade skin and whether their Illuminate holocron is lit.
//! Other players' looks come through the SJK hub ([`sjk_identity::Look`]): from the
//! presence roster when it changes and from the feed's look events as they come. The
//! local player's own look comes from its own settings (`cg_saberSkin`, gated by the
//! unlocks of its hub profile, and its Illuminate), never from the hub. Blade skins are
//! named by their ids in the catalogue ([`crate::unlockables`]).
//!
//! A hub look counts only while the game shows, in its slot, the name the claim was
//! made under (the badges' and emotes' rule, [`sjk_identity::names_match`]). The
//! table is rebuilt when a roster or an event comes and twice a second, so a player
//! who leaves a slot loses the look at once for the renderer; a frame only reads the
//! fixed [`Worn`] table.
//!
//! The renderer reads [`Looks::saber_skin_id`], [`Looks::illuminated`] and
//! [`Looks::own_saber_skin`] on `GpuState::looks`, and [`Looks::revision`] tells it
//! when what is worn changed (`GpuState::sync_saber_skins`). A player muted on this PC
//! (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "Muting a player") wears nothing: the stock blade, its sounds,
//! no holocron ([`Looks::set_muted`]).
