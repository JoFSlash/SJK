//! Holocrons (`docs/holocrons.md`): loot a player earns by playing. The SJK hub rolls and
//! stores them; the client shows them. Opening one gives a sealed card and credits
//! ([`crate::cards`]).
//!
//! This is the one place that says which tiers the client knows and how each looks: its
//! wire id, name, colour and odds ([`TIERS`]), and how a profile's entries and the hub's
//! progress read ([`entries`], [`counts_of`], [`next_text`]). Everything that draws a
//! holocron reads these: the drop pop-up ([`crate::holocron_popup`]), the chat lines
//! ([`line`]), the staff page and the Profile screen's Holocrons tab (which reads the
//! counts, the list and the progress from the identity's snapshot once, in
//! [`crate::console::holocrons_panel::Data::of`]). An id the client does not know is left
//! out.
//!
//! | piece | module |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | what counts as actively playing, and the input clock | [`activity`] |
//! | the tier gem, drawn when a tier has no icon | [`gem`] |
//! | the tiers' icons in the UI atlas | [`icons`] |
