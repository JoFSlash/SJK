# Illuminate's holocron

The Illuminate toy (SJK's own, not a Force power, [client.md](../../../../docs/client.md#illuminate))
shows a holocron floating by the player's shoulder. Its pictures were generated
by Sol (07/10/2026): a holocron icon in the style of Jedi Academy's Force icons
(1024x1024, on a flat grey ground) and one face of the holocron (2048x2048). The
files here are made from those two by [holocron_assets.py](../../../../scripts/holocron_assets.py),
so none is edited by hand except `holocron.shader`.

| File | Game path | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `toy_illuminate.png` | `gfx/sjk/toy_illuminate.png` | The toy's icon (quick wheel, Collection, key bindings), 128x128, like `gfx/mp/f_icon_*` |
| `holocron.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron.jpg` | The face, 512x512 |
| `holocron_glow.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_glow.jpg` | The face's emblem alone, for the additive stage |
| `holocron.md3` | `models/sjk/holocron.md3` | A 6-unit cube with the face on every side |
| `holocron.shader` | `shaders/sjk_holocron.shader` | `models/sjk/holocron`: lit face, glowing emblem |

The client mounts them in memory below all game data
([illuminate.rs](../../src/illuminate.rs)), so a PK3 that has the same paths
replaces them.

## Loot-box tiers

The holocron drops come in four tiers, each a holocron of its own since 17/10/2026
([holocrons.md](../../../../docs/holocrons.md#the-four-holocrons)): the Jedi cube
(uncommon, green), the Great Holocron (rare, blue), the Sith pyramid (legendary, purple)
and, since 21/10/2026, the engram (mythical, gold: triangular plates with glowing seams
and a white-hot core, breathing).
The cube, the pyramid and the engram are Sol's sculpted models (below). The kyber crystals (`kyber_uncommon`, `kyber_rare`,
`kyber_legendary`, `kyber_mythical`, 21/10/2026: the kyber prism that was the mythical
holocron until then, in each tier's colours, plainer the commoner) are made with them
([holocrons.md](../../../../docs/holocrons.md#kyber-crystals)). The shapes are in
[holocron_forms.py](../../../../scripts/holocron_forms.py), the pictures and shaders in
[holocron_assets.py](../../../../scripts/holocron_assets.py), which writes everything
below. Colour is not the only cue: besides the shapes, the tiers climb in how much they
glow (the emblem's and the lit parts' brightness and breathing), so they also tell apart
by lightness, for viewers who cannot rely on hue.

Per form `<tier>` (`uncommon`, `rare`, `legendary`, `mythical`, then `kyber_uncommon` ...
`kyber_mythical`), all mounted in memory like the files above (the list the client mounts,
`holocron_files.rs`, is written by the script too):

| File | Game path | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `holocron_<tier>.md3` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>.md3` | The body: the part that stands still against the holocron |
| `holocron_<tier>_<part>.md3` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>_<part>.md3` | Each moving part, about its own centre: `rare_halo`; `legendary_cap`, `legendary_eye`; `mythical_shell` (the engram's plates; its body is the core), `mythical_mote` (a spark, drawn eight times); `kyber_<tier>_crystal`, `_ring_a`, `_ring_b` (legendary and mythical only), `_mote` (drawn 4, 6, 8, 10 times) |
| `..._locked.md3` | the same, `_locked` | Each of those in the locked look |
| `holocron_<tier>.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>.jpg` | The face, 512x512: the pentagon, the kyber crystal's facet; 1024x1024 for a sculpted form (the cube, the pyramid, the engram), its baked colour |
| `holocron_<tier>_glow.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>_glow.jpg` | Its lit parts alone, for the additive and glow stage |
| `holocron_<tier>_locked.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>_locked.jpg` | The face drained of colour and dark |
| `holocron_<tier>_light.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>_light.jpg` | The lit parts' colour (lamps, edges, halo, seam, eye, motes), 64x64 |
| `holocron_<tier>.png` | `gfx/sjk/holocron_<tier>.png` | UI icon, 256x256 with alpha: the holocron drawn from its parts, a little from above, with a halo in the tier's colour (the mythical ones a glint too), for a dark UI |
| `holocron_<tier>_small.png` | `gfx/sjk/holocron_<tier>_small.png` | The same, 64x64 |

Shared:

| File | Game path | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `holocron_steel.jpg`, `holocron_steel_locked.jpg` | `models/sjk/...` | Brushed steel in the face's plate colour (the kyber crystals' sheaths and rings), tiling |
| `holocron_legendary_cap.jpg`, `..._locked.jpg` | `models/sjk/...` | The Sith pyramid's floating cap, baked from Sol's sculpted model |
| `holocron_uncommon_n.png`, `holocron_legendary_n.png`, `holocron_legendary_cap_n.png`, `holocron_mythical_n.png` | `models/sjk/...` | The sculpted forms' tangent-space normal maps (`normalMap` in the lit stage) |
| `holocron_light_locked.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_light_locked.jpg` | Every tier's lit parts in the locked look |
| `holocron_sheen.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_sheen.jpg` | A soft diagonal stripe (128x128, tiles along s + t) that the kyber crystals' shaders scroll over the crystal (`tcMod scroll`) |
| `holocron_mythical_seam.jpg`, `_core.jpg` (and `_locked`) | `models/sjk/...` | The engram's seams' glow (the plates' walls and inner faces) and its core's facet (white-hot in the middle) |
| `holocron_mythical_env.jpg` | `models/sjk/holocron_mythical_env.jpg` | The engram's reflection, read by the view (`tcGen environment`): a faint warm sky and two thin streaks that sweep the plates as it turns |
| `holocron_tiers.shader` | `shaders/sjk_holocron_tiers.shader` | `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>`: the holocrons' faces, lit, glowing faintly of themselves, their lit parts breathing in the glow; the sculpted ones name their normal maps; the engram's plates also breathe out and back (`deformVertexes wave`, every vertex of a plate carrying the plate's normal so the slab moves as one) and take a reflection read by the view |
| `holocron_kyber.shader` | `shaders/sjk_holocron_kyber.shader` | `models/sjk/holocron_kyber_<tier>`: the crystals' facets (lit, own light, glow, sheen) and each crystal's light |
| `holocron_parts.shader` | `shaders/sjk_holocron_parts.shader` | The steel, the dark metal, the Sith pyramid's cap, each holocron tier's light (full bright, breathing in the glow), the engram's seams (pulsing, breathing with the plates) and core |
| `holocron_locked.shader` | `shaders/sjk_holocron_locked.shader` | The locked look of every material: lit, a faint light of its own, no glow, nothing moving |
| `holocron_parts.rs` | (not mounted) | The forms' table the client includes (`holocrons/stage.rs`, `FORMS`): each form's id and light, each part's models, where it rests and how it bobs, orbits and turns |
| `holocron_files.rs` | (not mounted) | Every file above at its game path, included by `illuminate.rs`, which mounts them |

A surface's shader is named by its model file, so every part is a model of its own in each
look. The shaders use only stock Quake 3 / Jedi Academy keywords (`rgbGen lightingDiffuse`,
`identity` and `wave`, `blendFunc GL_ONE GL_ONE`, `tcMod scale` and `scroll`, `glow`); the
tests in [illuminate.rs](../../src/illuminate.rs) parse them with the client's shader
parser and check every picture they name is mounted. Everything comes out of
`holocron.jpg`, so nothing of the originals is needed to remake the tiers.

### Sol's art for the faces

Two pictures come from Sol's generated pictures (17/10/2026), kept in `art/` at 1024x1024
(not mounted; the script reads them each time it remakes the tiers, and draws its own
face for a tier whose picture is missing). A picture is any size and colour; its lit
parts (bright, or strongly coloured) are painted along the tier's colours and glow:

- `art/rare.jpg`: one pentagon of the Great Holocron on black, a corner at the top; the
  script cuts it out and fits it to the face's pentagon;
- `art/kyber.jpg`: a tiling crystal texture, worked into the kyber crystals' facets (it was
  `art/mythical.jpg` while the kyber prism was the mythical holocron).

The Sith pyramid is Sol's sculpted model (05/11/2026), in `art/sith_pyramid/`: Sol
generated it (Tripo, about 940 000 triangles with an 8K picture), and it was brought down
in Blender to a low poly of 58 triangles (`sith_pyramid.obj`, objects `low_body` and
`low_cap`, z up, its foot on z = 0) with the detail baked from the high one: `body.jpg`
and `cap.jpg` (colour times 60 % of the baked ambient occlusion, 1024 and 256),
`body_glow.jpg` (the purple runes and lines alone, for the glow stage) and `body_n.png`,
`cap_n.png` (tangent-space normal maps, green along the picture's t, downward: Blender bakes green up, so its green is flipped, the convention of the world's rend2 maps). The script scales the model
by 7 (`SITH_SCALE`), keeps the body's flat top under the eye and models the cap about its
own centre; the eye is still drawn by the script. To change the shape, edit the low poly
in Blender, bake again and export it triangulated with normals and picture coordinates.

The Jedi cube and the engram are Sol's sculpted models too (08/11/2026), in
`art/jedi_cube/` and `art/gold_engram/` (`<folder>.obj`): Sol generated them (Tripo, about
1.9 million triangles with an 8K picture each). The cube is one object `low_body`, the
convex hull of the high one dissolved flat and decimated to 300 triangles. The engram is
38 objects `plate_NN`, one per tile: the high poly's faces within 2 % of its size of the
convex hull fall apart at the grooves into one patch per tile, and each patch's outline in
its own plane (grown by 6 %) is a flat plate, 301 triangles in all. Each has `body.jpg` (the base colour baked
through an emission pass, as a diffuse bake drops a metal's colour, times 60 % of the
baked ambient occlusion), `body_glow.jpg` (the cube's green glass alone; the engram's dark
rims round its plates, in a warm gold-white) and `body_n.png` (green flipped as above).
The script centres each on the holocron and scales it (the engram's plates become slabs
with walls and an inner face, `PLATE_DEPTH` deep, round a core it sizes inside them) (`JEDI_CUBE_SCALE`,
`GOLD_ENGRAM_SCALE`); the share of each glow picture the glow stage adds is `SCULPTS` in
holocron_assets.py.

`--art <key>=<picture>` (`rare`, `kyber`) tries another picture without replacing the file:

    python scripts/holocron_assets.py tiers crates/sjk-viewer/assets/holocron --art rare=pentagon.png


### Light colours

The point light of each tier (the one the 3D menu uses; a kyber crystal casts its tier's), in the scale
of `COLOR` in `illuminate.rs` (`[1.5, 1.3, 1.0]`, Illuminate's warm white): linear RGB
floats, not clamped. They are in [holocron_assets.py](../../../../scripts/holocron_assets.py)
as `Tier.light` too; the tiers rise in strength (the sum of the three) as they rise in
tier.

| Id | R | G | B | Sum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uncommon` | 0.55 | 1.50 | 0.60 | 2.65 |
| `rare` | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.75 | 3.25 |
| `legendary` | 1.25 | 0.45 | 1.75 | 3.45 |
| `mythical` | 1.85 | 1.30 | 0.40 | 3.55 |

```rust
const TIER_LIGHTS: [(&str, [f32; 3]); 4] = [
    ("uncommon", [0.55, 1.50, 0.60]),
    ("rare", [0.50, 1.00, 1.75]),
    ("legendary", [1.25, 0.45, 1.75]),
    ("mythical", [1.85, 1.30, 0.40]),
];
```

## Regenerating

With Python 3 and Pillow, numpy and scipy (`pip install pillow numpy scipy`),
from the repository root. Everything, from Sol's two originals (the tiers follow
from the new face):

```sh
python scripts/holocron_assets.py icon.jpg face.jpg crates/sjk-viewer/assets/holocron
```

Only the tiers (pictures, icons, sheen and shader), from the `holocron.jpg` in the
folder; the output is deterministic, and it is the `TIERS` table in the script that
sets the colours, the glow ladder, the shader's waves and the lights:

```sh
python scripts/holocron_assets.py tiers crates/sjk-viewer/assets/holocron
```
