//! The background service that keeps the player registered with the hub, repeats
//! their game-server claim while they play, tells the hub the look they wear there,
//! and reads who else on that server is known. Nothing here blocks a frame: the viewer sends [`Command`]s through
//! [`Service`] and reads a [`Snapshot`].
//!
//! Once registered, and only when told where ([`Service::keep_assets`]), it also keeps
//! the hub's asset packs ([`crate::assets`]) in a cache folder.
//!
//! The service is inert while it is disabled or has no hub address: it makes no
//! request of any kind.
