//! Trades between players (`PROTOCOL.md` in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub, "Trades between players";
//! 22/10/2026): two players swap unopened holocrons and duplicate saber shaders through
//! the hub. The hub holds the trade and checks both sides twice; the client asks, shows
//! and answers.
//!
//! The identity worker keeps the player's trades in [`crate::Snapshot::trades`]: read when
//! the hub's feed tells of a change (`trades` in [`crate::Feed`]), after every step the
//! player takes, and while a trade is open every few seconds so its clocks stay true.
//! Every limit and worth comes from the hub ([`TradeRules`]): the client never holds
//! numbers of its own.
