//! Chat bans (`PROTOCOL.md` in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub, "Chat bans"): a verified or staff
//! player bans a player the hub does not vouch for from the SJK chat for 24 hours,
//! with no reason asked and no wait between bans. The hub bans the person's key and
//! the address it last saw them use, so a new key from there cannot write either; a
//! verified key from that address still can. Staff lift bans
//! ([`crate::StaffRequest::ChatUnban`]).
//!
//! What the player reads of a ban is worded here: the time a ban ends, in local time
//! as `dd/mm HH:MM` (SJK writes dates day first and times on the 24-hour clock), and
//! why the hub did not take one.
