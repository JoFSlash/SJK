//! Announcements and contributor reward rounds (`PROTOCOL.md` in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub,
//! "Announcements" and "Reward rounds", 25/10/2026): what the hub sends about them, the
//! creator's request to announce, and the rules an announcement keeps.
//!
//! An announcement is an official message from the SJK team, shown in the SJK chat only
//! (never in a game server's chat). A reward round is a list of contributors the SJK team
//! rewards: everyone reads who and why, and each person claims what they got, which only
//! they see. The feed relays both as they are made ([`crate::Feed::announcements`],
//! [`crate::Feed::rounds`]), and the chat shows each as a line marked [`Official`] (a
//! [`crate::ChatMessage`] whose [`crate::ChatMessage::official`] is set), so the game's
//! chat, the docked chat and the chat page show it where it came.
