# JoF content

JoF content downloads the JoF community's maps, skins, hilts and packs from JoF's
own repository, the files JoF's launcher
([jof-launcher](https://github.com/JoFKypdurron/jof-launcher), by Kypdurron, MIT)
installs, and loads them in SJK. It is part of JoF tools: built with the `mod-jof`
feature, named `jof.*`, and its card is SJK UI in every menu style. Sol, a JoF
member, asked for it on 16/10/2026, after Kypdurron pointed Sol to the launcher.

**JoF's files, JoF's responsibility.** JoF chooses and publishes the files; SJK
hosts none of them and only downloads what a player picks, so it is not responsible
for their content. The card says so under its title.

**Off by default (Sol's rule).** Nothing loads until the player turns on
`jof.content`, and nothing downloads until they press Download on the card, or turn
on [automatic updates](#automatic-updates). Optional groups (the event map pack, the
cosmetics, the JKA HD Pack) are never chosen by default.

## Where the files go

Into SJK's own JoF folder, `jof` beside SJK's settings (`GameData/SJK/jof`), or
`jof.contentFolder`. The files sit in its `base` folder, as the launcher puts them in
the game's `base`. SJK never writes to the game's installation.

While `jof.content` is on, that folder is one more content root in the search paths
([asset_search_paths.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/asset_search_paths.rs),
`set_extra_root`), standing in for the launcher's files in the installation: inside
each game folder its PK3s sort by name among the installation's, as if they were in
the same folder (`sjk_vfs::pk3_search_order_merged`). So `jof/base` packs take the
place the launcher's layout gives them in `GameData/base`: above `assets0.pk3`, below a
player's own `zz_*.pk3` (Kushina's report, hub #100), and all below
`fs_basegame`/`fs_game`. The roots are read at every mount, so turning the switch on or
off, or a finished download, applies from the next map, with no restart. The JoF
packs also show in the asset browser, and server downloads (`cl_allowDownload`) see
them, so a map already in the JoF folder is not downloaded from the server again.

A file the game's `base` already holds with the manifest's MD5 (JoF's launcher put it
there) counts as here and is never fetched again. SJK leaves the game folder's files
alone: it never updates, moves or removes them.

## The repository

[sjk-jof-content](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/lib.rs) reads JoF's manifest
(`getclouddata`), the same one the launcher reads
(`lib/services/cloud_service.dart`):

- **Groups.** Only `data.assetgroups` is used: each group has an id, name,
  description, a type (`REQUIRED`, `RECOMMENDED`, `OPTIONAL`; others such as
  `DEPRECATED` are left out) and its files. `clientgroups` (JoF's EternalJK client),
  `modgroups` (the JA+ and Tarascii client plugins, which SJK supports in its core) and
  `othergroups` are not read.
- **Files.** Each file has a name, a size, an MD5, a `localfolder` (where the repository
  serves it) and a `targetfolder`. `Base` files are fetched. A file for another folder
  (one cosmetics file targets `EternalJK`, JoF's own client) is listed as "for JoF's own
  client" and never fetched. A file whose name or folder is not one plain name (a
  separator, `..`, a drive, a character Windows refuses), that is not a `.pk3`, or that
  has no MD5 is left out, so the manifest can never name a path outside the folder.
- **Hosts** ([source.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/source.rs)), a table read by
  generic code: JoF Cloud (`cloud.jof.app`, an hourly copy that JoF runs to take load
  off the origin) and jofhub.eu (the origin). `jof.contentSource` is `auto` (JoF Cloud,
  then jofhub.eu, as the launcher does), `mirror` or `origin`. Since 28/10/2026 the SJK
  hub names the hosts (`GET /v1/content-sources`, asked before each list), so SJK can
  move JoF content to other hosts or switch it off for everyone (the hub's empty list:
  "switched off by SJK for now") without a release; the player's choice picks among the
  hosts it names, and the table here is used when the hub can't be asked. A file is
  `<host root>/<localfolder>/<name>`, each segment percent-encoded on its own, so names
  such as `{JoF}'s-GWing.pk3` work.
- **Checks** ([download.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/download.rs)). A file is
  written to `<name>.part` and renamed into place only when its size and MD5 match the
  manifest, so the game never mounts half a file. A stopped download carries on from
  its `.part` with an HTTP `Range` request. A file that fails on one host (missing, or an
  older copy that fails its MD5) is tried on the next. Requests name the client as
  `SJK/<version> (JoF content)`.
- **The disk** ([store.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/store.rs)). Each file is
  Installed (in SJK's folder, matching), In the game folder (matching), Outdated (in
  SJK's folder, not matching) or Missing. MD5s are kept in `jof/sjk-jof-content.json`
  with the size and modification time they were measured at, so only new or changed
  files are hashed again.
- **A sync** ([plan.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/plan.rs)) downloads the wanted
  files that are missing (a file is wanted by its own pick, else by its group's tick),
  smallest first. It deletes only files SJK itself
  downloaded (marked in the record): its copies of files no chosen group lists, and
  those the manifest no longer has or the game folder holds already. A PK3 put in the
  JoF folder by hand stays. Since 31/10/2026 the record also notes the group each file
  was downloaded for (`group`), which automatic updates read. It runs on its own thread
  ([job.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/job.rs)) and goes on while the card is closed
  or the player plays.
- **The game's folder is never SJK's.** A `jof.contentFolder` whose `base` is the
  game's own `base` is refused ("the JoF folder is the game's own folder").

## The card

`jof.downloads`, or Settings > General > JoF content (Simple) or Mods > JoF content (Advanced), Enter
([jof_content_card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/jof_content_card.rs)). A pop-up card
(1200 by 888, the kit's scrim and glass) in every menu style:

- **Top:** "JoF content" in gold, what it is, Close, and under them whose the files
  are (Sol's request, 16/10/2026): "JoF chooses and publishes these files and is
  responsible for them; SJK only downloads what you pick and is not responsible for
  their content."
- **Use JoF content:** the switch (`jof.content`), with what it does said plainly (off
  by default, nothing fetched until Download; on, loaded from the next map, off leaves
  the files unused on disk), the folder, and that the game folder's files are used as
  they are.
- **Update automatically:** the second switch (`jof.contentAuto`), with one line: off by
  default; on, it checks at start and every hour and downloads only the groups marked
  Auto ([automatic updates](#automatic-updates)).
- **Groups:** one row per group, six at a time (wheel and Page Up/Down for more): its
  tick (`jof.contentGroups`: `default` for the repository's own choice, else the ids
  chosen; Space, or a click on the box), name, type and description, and on the right
  what is here ("16 of 35 here · 3.3 GB to download", "All 157 here", "3 of 157 chosen
  · 75 MB to download", "Not chosen · 200 MB to remove") over its count and size.
  A group with only files for JoF's own client has no tick. Beside the name, its Auto
  tick (`jof.contentAutoGroups`; A on the row, or a click), dimmed while Update
  automatically is off.
- **A group's files** (Sol's request, 16/10/2026: pick precisely what to take). Enter,
  Right or a click on a group's row shows its files: "‹ Groups / <name>" (a click, Esc,
  Left or Backspace goes back where the player was), the group's own row ("All of
  <name>", how many are chosen; its tick takes every file, or leaves them all out when
  every one was taken; its Auto tick, A or a click, marks the group), then seven files
  at a time: tick, name, the repository's
  description, what a download does with it (To download, To update, Here, In game
  folder, To remove, Not chosen, JoF's client only) and its size. Space, Enter or a
  click picks a file alone. Picks against the group's tick are kept in
  `jof.contentFiles` (`+<id>` taken, `-<id>` left out); a pick that matches the tick
  again is forgotten, and the group's tick forgets them all.
- **Foot:** what a download would do, or the job's progress with a gold bar (asking
  for the list, checking the files already here, removing, downloading file n of m),
  how it ended, or why the repository could not be reached; Check again (F5), and the
  main button: Download <size>, Remove <size>, Up to date, or Stop while a job runs.
  Download stays dimmed while the switch is off. While both switches are on, the last
  line says when the next automatic check runs ("Next automatic check 14:05", the
  player's 24-hour clock).

Opening the card the first time in a run fetches the list and looks at the disk. The
first look hashes every matching file in the game's `base` once (about a minute for
10 GB on Sol's PC in a debug build); later looks use the record.

## Automatic updates

Sol's request, 31/10/2026: a player can let the collections keep themselves up to
date, and choose which groups. Off by default.

- **When.** For each collection (JoF content, the [Sith cloud](sith-cloud.md)) whose
  switch (`jof.content`) and automatic switch (`jof.contentAuto`) are both on: 30
  seconds after the client starts, then every hour, quietly in the background, in the
  menus or during a match (the files load from the next map, as after Download).
  Turning Update automatically on from the card brings the next check to 30 seconds
  later. A collection whose card's job is at work (the player pressed Download or Check
  again) is skipped until the next hour: one job at a time per collection, as the run
  is the card's own job ([job.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/job.rs), `Job::auto`),
  and the card shows its progress while open (Stop stops it).
- **What.** The groups marked Auto, `jof.contentAutoGroups`: `all` (the default: every
  group the player takes files from), or group ids (empty for none). Inside a group the
  player's picks still decide which files are wanted. A run refreshes the list, then
  fetches the wanted files of the Auto groups that are missing or outdated, and removes
  only files SJK downloaded for an Auto group that the list no longer has
  (`Plan::auto` in [plan.rs](../crates/sjk-jof-content/src/plan.rs), the card's plan
  restricted to those groups). It never removes a file the player left out (their own
  Download does that), never touches the other groups, and leaves files downloaded
  before 31/10/2026 (whose group the record does not know) for Download to clean.
- **Telling the player.** A run that downloaded or removed something gives one small
  card at the top of the screen (the unlock pop-up's, in holo blue and without the
  sound): "JoF content updated", "3 files, 120 MB · from the next map". Nothing shows
  when nothing changed. A hub that says the collection is off, a host that cannot be
  reached, or a file that fails (a PK3 the running retail game holds) costs a log line
  ("automatic update ...") and is tried again the next hour; no error pop-up.
- **Cost.** The client asks each frame only whether an `Instant` has passed
  (`Card::auto_due`) and, while a run goes, whether its thread finished; the settings
  are read and the job started only when a check is due.

Code: the scheduler and the switch are on the card
([jof_content_card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/jof_content_card.rs)), driven for
both collections by the same code through each collection's setting names (`NAMES`
in [jof_content.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/jof_content.rs) and
[sith_cloud.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sith_cloud.rs);
[console_jof_content.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/console_jof_content.rs),
`content_auto`), from the identity's per-frame hook.

## Settings and commands

| Name | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jof.content` | 0 | Load the JoF folder's files (from the next map) |

| `jof.contentFiles` | empty | Files picked against their group: `+<id>` taken, `-<id>` left out |
| `jof.contentAuto` | 0 | Update automatically: at start and every hour (needs `jof.content`); Settings > General or Mods > JoF content auto-update |
| `jof.contentAutoGroups` | `all` | Groups updated automatically: `all` (those you take files from), ids, or empty for none; the card's Auto ticks write it |
| `jof.contentSource` | `auto` | `auto`, `mirror` (JoF Cloud) or `origin` (jofhub.eu); Settings > Mods > JoF content host |
| `jof.contentFolder` | empty | The folder; empty is `jof` beside SJK's settings |

## Verification

- Unit tests: manifest reading and unsafe names (`manifest::tests`), host addresses
  (`source::tests`), the disk look and its MD5 record (`store::tests`), the plan
  (`plan::tests`), checked, resumed, refused and stopped downloads against a local
  HTTP server (`download::tests`), a whole sync (`job::tests`), the extra root's place
  in the search paths (`asset_search_paths::tests`), and the card's lines and button
  (`jof_content_card::tests`).
- Automatic updates (31/10/2026): the Auto groups' setting and the restricted plan
  (`plan::tests::automatic_groups_parse_save_and_follow_the_choice`,
  `an_automatic_update_keeps_to_its_groups`), a whole automatic run against a local
  HTTP server that fetches and removes only in its group and notes the group
  (`job::tests::an_automatic_update_fetches_and_removes_only_in_its_groups`), the
  record's group (`store::tests`), the schedule and the clock shown, the switch and
  the Auto ticks' keys, and a quiet check's line
  (`jof_content_card::tests::the_automatic_check_comes_soon_after_the_start_then_hourly`,
  `the_automatic_switch_and_auto_ticks_answer_keys`,
  `a_quiet_automatic_check_says_what_is_here`), nothing started without both
  switches and a group
  (`jof_content::tests::an_automatic_update_waits_for_both_switches_and_a_group`), and
  the small card's words (`unlock_toast::tests::the_words_of_medals_and_holocrons`).
  The off-screen render test checks the switch and every row's Auto tick, at 1080p
  with Sol's `GameData` (`SJK_JOF_CONTENT_AUTO=1`, and a group's files with automatic
  updates off). Not verified in game: an hourly run in a real session, during a
  match, or its small card on screen.
- Against the live repository on 16/10/2026 (`cargo test -p sjk-jof-content --test live
  -- --ignored`): both hosts gave the manifest (7 groups, no file left out) and
  `{JoF}UI.pk3`, checked by MD5. With Sol's `GameData`, the files JoF's launcher had
  installed were recognised (for example 118 of 157 skins, 16 of 35 essential maps).
- The card rendered off screen (`jof_content_card::tests::the_jof_content_card_renders_on_a_gpu`,
  1080p, with the switch off and on).
- Not yet verified: a full download of a group in the game, a JoF map loaded from the
  JoF folder on a JoF server, and the HD Pack's effect on SJK's material maps.
