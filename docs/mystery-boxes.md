# Mystery boxes

Boxes SJK's creator places on maps, which any SJK player opens for credits (Sol's idea,
27/10/2026). The hub keeps where each box stands, takes the price, rolls what is inside
and pays it; the client draws the boxes on the map file they were placed on, opens the one
the player faces with `+use`, and shows what came out to the opener and to the SJK players
around. Code: [mystery_box.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/mystery_box.rs), the hub calls in
[sjk-identity's mystery_box.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/mystery_box.rs).

No game server knows of a box. It is drawn by SJK clients only, has no collision (players
walk through it), and players on other clients see someone pressing Use at nothing.

The box is SJK's own (bundled, `assets/mystery_box`, made by
[mystery_box_model.py](../scripts/mystery_box_model.py)): a long wooden chest bound in
iron, 60 x 26 x 24 units, a pale question mark glowing (pulsing) on each half of its two
long sides, and a lid hinged at the back that swings open while it rolls and closes once
what came out is taken. Since 30/10/2026 (Sol: "not just that rectangle") it stands on
four iron feet under a plinth, its three iron bands and four corner posts stand out of the
planks, an iron rim runs round its top, a lock plate hangs on its front and a handle on
each end, and its lid arches, banded too. Since 31/10/2026 it is open under its lid, dark
walls and a floor inside (Sol: the top looked sealed with wood; it was closed with
planks and the bands' tops crossed it), and a faint halo of warm light rises 52 units
round its top, its rays drifting slowly, so a box is found from afar (Sol's idea; a second
surface of the chest's model, `models/sjk/mystery_box_halo`, added and two-sided).

Words stand in the world over every box, in the headline font (Fira Sans Condensed, as
centre prints), for every SJK player who sees it (hidden behind
walls, fading out past 1000 units, gone past 1400): "MYSTERY BOX" and its price (or "Free
roll: press Use" for a player holding one), "Rolling..." while it rolls, then what came
out ("JACKPOT!", "DOUBLE!", "CREDITS BACK" or "EMPTY", and the credits; the opener's also
says to press Use to take it).

## Opening one

Standing at a box (within 80 units across the floor and 96 up or down) and facing it
(within 60 degrees), the player sees the [Use prompt](client.md#use-prompt) by the
crosshair: the key bound to `+use` in a cap, then "Open mystery box" over its price or
"Free roll" (since 30/10/2026; a centre print said it once before). `+use` asks the hub to
open it; the hub refuses without the price, within the cooldown or when the box is gone,
and the refusal shows in the centre of the screen. What the client knows already, the
prompt says instead, its cap greyed: "Your turn again in N s", "100 credits: not
enough", "Opening..." while the hub answers, "Someone is opening it" at another player's
roll; it says "Take it" over the player's own prize, and nothing while their own roll
runs or at a box that blows up.

**The cooldown** (Sol, 30/10/2026): a player opens one box every 15 seconds (3 before,
the hub's `cooldown`), so a roll and its taking, about 8 seconds, leave the box free a
while for another player. The client knows its own last opening and says so on the Use
prompt without asking the hub.

An opened box plays its opening sound and its roll while it rattles and things rise out of
it and roll over it, changing fast, then slower, like a wound-down spring. At 5.2 seconds
(5.5 before 30/10/2026), on the roll's last note, it stops on what came out and plays a
chime (credits back), a fanfare (the jackpot) or a locked door (empty). As its lid closes
(taken, or after 10 seconds) it plays its closing sound.

The opening, the roll and the closing are Sol's sounds of 30/10/2026, in the optional SJK
extras pack (`unofficial_sjk_extras.pk3`, the Sith cloud's `extras`:
`sound/sjk/mystery_box/extras_open.mp3`, `extras_roll.mp3`, `extras_close.mp3`), not
bundled. A player without the pack hears a crate sliding open (retail) and a little music
box tune (SJK's own, bundled: `assets/mystery_box`, made by
[mystery_box_assets.py](../scripts/mystery_box_assets.py), its last chord at 5.2 s), and
no closing sound. Both rolls end together, so every client stops at the same time.

| Outcome | Stops on |
| --- | --- |
| `empty` | a handful of bolts |
| `refund` | a blue crystal |
| `double` | a green crystal |
| `jackpot` | a red crystal |
| `explode` | a teddy bear (a thermal detonator before 30/10/2026) |
| `holocron` | the tier's own holocron, every part of it, for the opener; SJK's holocron for the others (the hub tells them no tier) |
| `shards` | three cyan kyber crystals; seven, bigger, for the opener's pile of more than 15 shards |
| `again` | a little mystery box |
| `blade` | a saber hilt; for an opener who holds the blade already, the shards it pays instead |

What rolls before it stops is only these prizes (Sol, 29/10/2026: the game's weapons
rolled with them before, which no box gave), but the teddy bear, which only comes at the
end (30/10/2026), among them both piles of shards and the
four tiers' holocrons, Uncommon to Mythical, each drawn as the Holocrons tab draws it,
its parts posed and turning (`mystery_box::HOLOCRONS`, Sol, 29/10/2026; before, one
holocron for all). `world_shot::mystery_box_shots::duel6_mystery_box_holocrons` shows the
four, and `duel6_mystery_box_loot` the piles, the little box and the hilt.

The opener is told what came out in the centre of the screen. It floats over the box,
turning slowly, until they take it with `+use` at the box (a sparkle; a chat line gives
the credits left) or for 10 seconds, when it is taken for them. Meanwhile the box is busy:
another player's Use prompt there says someone is opening it. The hub pays at the opening
itself, so walking away loses nothing. The other SJK players on the server see and hear
the same roll through the hub's toy event (`mystery_box`, `open_<box>_<outcome>`). When
the opener takes what came out, their client tells each other SJK player on the server
through the toy relay (`mystery_box`, `take_<box>`, one player every 50 ms), and their box
closes too, with the take and closing sounds (30/10/2026; before, they saw it float for
the 10 seconds). Only the opener's take closes it; a player who misses it sees it go at
the 10 seconds.

Every sound plays at the box on a sound source of the box's own (`0x5200_0000` and its id),
never an entity's: the audio moves an entity's sounds to where it is, so box sounds once
followed the player on slot 0 (bug report #185).

Settings > Sound > Toys, "Mystery box sounds" (`s_toyMysteryBoxSound`), silences them.

The price and the odds are the hub's (`GET /v1/mystery-boxes`), PROVISIONAL, Sol's to tune:

| Outcome | Chance | Pays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `empty` | 36 % | nothing |
| `refund` | 24 % | the price back |
| `double` | 5 % | twice the price |
| `jackpot` | 1 % | five times the price |
| `explode` | 12 % | nothing: the price goes to a hunter |
| `holocron` | 10 % | a holocron |
| `shards` | 6 % | 10 to 25 kyber shards |
| `again` | 5 % | a free roll |
| `blade` | 1 % | the Mystery blade (60 shards if you hold it) |

On average a box pays back 39 of its 100 credits, and a holocron one time in ten (Sol,
29/10/2026 in the evening: 79 before, which a player rolling a hundred times barely felt;
double was 15%, jackpot 5%, empty 29% and explode 5%). A holocron came one time in fifty
before 29/10/2026, with empty 43% and refund 30%. The last three came the same day (Sol: "loot you
can land on"), their odds taken from empty (39% before) and refund (26%). A
newer hub's outcome the client does not know is shown by its credits alone.

**It blows up** (`explode`, Sol's idea of 28/10/2026, after Call of Duty zombies' boxes):
the roll stops on a teddy bear (since 30/10/2026; a thermal detonator before; SJK's own,
bundled, made by [teddy_bear_model.py](../scripts/teddy_bear_model.py)), and the box
laughs, "a ghost having fun" (`LAUGH`, Sol's laugh of 29/10/2026,
`sound/sjk/mystery_box/laugh.mp3`, in the optional SJK extras pack; a player without the
pack hears the retail gloat, `sound/chars/alora/misc/gloat1.mp3`). 1.5 seconds later, with
a detpack's explosion (`detpack/explosion`, `sound/weapons/detpack/explode.mp3`) where
the opener stands, it kills them: their own client sends the game's `kill`, which the
server carries out, so every player sees them die (Sol, 30/10/2026; before, their client
threw them down as a [ragdoll](client.md#ragdoll) and they got up). Not in a duel, with
the flag, or wherever the Ragdoll could not strike them (`Ragdoll::strikable`). The
laugh plays at the box for every SJK player who sees the roll (before 30/10/2026, to
every hunter wherever they were, at the opening). The hub hands what they paid (nothing
for a free roll) to another player on the server with the Box hunt toy on, at random;
with nobody else hunting there, it is lost. The opener reads where it went as it blows
up; the one who got the credits reads it in the centre of the screen and the other
hunters in the chat once the roll stops on the bear (the hub's box hunt event
`laugh_<opener>_<to>_<credits>`, which arrives at the opening, held for the roll).

**A holocron** (`holocron`, 28/10/2026): the roll stops on the tier's holocron, and the hub
gives one of any tier, rolled on the holocrons' own odds ([holocrons.md](holocrons.md));
it counts against no daily cap and cannot be traded (source `box`). The opener reads its
tier over the box and in the centre, and finds it in the Collection.

**Shards, a free roll, the Mystery blade** (`shards`, `again`, `blade`, 29/10/2026): a
pile of 10 to 25 kyber shards to spend in the shop; a free roll, spent on the next box
the player opens like one won in the box hunt (the hub's answer says the free rolls left,
`free`, and the client keeps that count); or the boxes' own saber shader, the Mystery
blade (`saber_mystery`, blade 169, Legendary), which no holocron drops, the shop never
sells and nobody trades. A player who holds it already gets 60 shards instead, what
shattering a Legendary shader gives. The blade fanfares like the jackpot.

## Placing one (SJK's creator)

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `mysterybox_place [server]` | Place a box where you aim, facing you: on every server running this map file, or with `server` on this one only |
| `mysterybox_remove [id]` | Remove the box nearest you (within 256 units), or the one with that id |
| `mysterybox_list` | The boxes on this map, their ids and distance, and the price (anyone) |

The map editor's Place page (`mapedit_panel`) shows the creator Mystery box and Remove
box beside Place model; Mystery box follows the editor's scope (All servers or This
server). Placing needs the map's BSP checksum (as map edits do, `sv_mapChecksum`): the box
stands in that exact map file only. The hub takes the creator's request only; every
placing and removal goes to the staff log. The client reads the hub's list once registered,
every 10 minutes, and at once after a placing, a removal or a box that is gone.

Some of its sounds are retail (the crate sliding open, the chime, the fanfare, the locked
door, the box hunt's alarm, the gloat); the tune and the take are SJK's own; the opening,
roll, closing and laugh of the extras pack are Sol's.

## Box hunt

Players opt in with the Box hunt toy (`toy_boxhunt`, Collection > Toys, the quick wheel;
look toy `box_hunt`); with it off a player is never the mark and is told nothing of the
hunt. Among the players of a server with it on and in play (at least 3), the hub picks a
mark at random for 3 minutes, one mark at most every 10 minutes (Sol, 29/10/2026: from
one pick to the next; the hunt rests in between, also when the mark is killed or leaves).

**In play** (Sol, 31/10/2026; before, 2 players with the toy on, away or not): every read
of the hunt says whether the player is away: typing in the chat, in a menu, the console
or a dialog, spectating or following someone, at the intermission, or idle two minutes
(what holocrons count as playing, [holocrons.md](holocrons.md), and the chat besides). A
change is read at once (2 seconds apart at least). The hub picks nobody away, and needs 3
hunters in play; a hunter whose reads stopped for a minute counts as away. A mark away for
a minute since being picked hands it on: another hunter in play becomes the mark at once,
for a whole 3 minutes, told as any new mark is, when 3 others are in play; else they stay
the mark.

The mark is told in the centre of the screen ("You are the mark!"),
the other hunters by a chat line, and they see "MARK" in red over the mark's head
(hidden behind walls) and the mark's body ringed in red where they see it, the team
outlines' enemy ring (`hud::team_outline`, 29/10/2026), in every game type and whatever
`cg_teamOutline` says. While the game server sends the mark (they are in this player's
snapshot), a red arrow points at them through walls (Sol, 31/10/2026): over their head,
under the label, when they are in view, else on a ring round the crosshair pointing
their way. Every hunter, the mark too, hears the game's alarm
(`sound/effects/mpalarm.wav`, Sol's pick, 28/10/2026; with "Mystery box sounds") as a new
mark is picked, and a small card at the top centre of the screen names the mark (in
the headline font, "BOX HUNT · THE MARK" over the name) or, red, tells the player "YOU
ARE THE MARK"; its words take the menus' lifted colours (`text::CodePalette::Legible`), so
a black name reads on the dark card, and their shadow is the name without its colour
codes; its red edge flashes for 2 seconds as it arrives, and it stays until the
mark is hunted or the hub has no mark or another one. The card and the alarm are
[hunt.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/mystery_box/hunt.rs) and
[label.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/mystery_box/label.rs); the card draws with the words
in the world, so it is hidden with them (menus, console, scoreboard, intermission). A hunter who kills the mark wins a free mystery box roll: the
next box they open costs nothing (the centre says "press Use for your free roll" at a
box). The hunt then rests until 10 minutes after that mark was picked (a minute at
least). A hunter who wins nothing (they hold 3 unspent or won 5 that day) reads why in
the centre too (31/10/2026; before, in the chat only, so it looked like a kill that won
nothing).

The hub never sees kills, so the mark's own client says who killed it
(`POST /v1/box-hunt/killed`, from the game's obituary): a hunter cannot claim a kill it
did not make, only the mark could fail to tell. It tells it once its player is the mark
by the hub's event, before its next read (31/10/2026; a kill in those first seconds went
untold), and tries twice. The hub counts a kill only before the mark's end, so a client
stops showing the mark a second before it, by the seconds left the hub's read says
(`left`; by the end time and its own clock for an older hub), and reads again then: it
showed the mark up to 20 seconds after their end before 31/10/2026, and a hunter who
killed them then won nothing (a player's report). A hunter keeps at most 3 free rolls and
wins at most 5 a day. The client reads the hunt (`POST /v1/box-hunt`) every 20 seconds
while the toy is on or a box stands on the map, and at once after the hub's toy events
(`box_hunt`: `mark_<slot>`, `hunted_<slot>_<won>`). All the numbers are the hub's,
PROVISIONAL.

## Limits

- The hub cannot tell where a player stands: the reach is the client's.
- An outcome pays credits, blows the opener up or gives a holocron; other effects need a
  client release for each new kind.
- The explosion is SJK's only: no game server knows of it, so it hurts nobody else, and
  players on other clients see the opener die (the server's `kill`) with no box or
  explosion. A server that refuses `kill`, or counts it against the score, does so.
- Three friends with the toy on could take turns being killed for free rolls; the
  3-minute mark, the pause and the 5 a day cap how much that pays.
- Away is what the player's own client says: a modified client could say it is in play.
  The client of 31/10/2026 sends `away`, which a hub before that day refuses (its read
  takes no other field): the hub goes first.
- The arrow shows the mark only while the game server sends them, which it does by what
  the player could see (the PVS), not across the whole map.
- Verified: unit tests (the pick of the faced box, which boxes stand on a map file and
  server, the roll slowing to its prize, the stop, the take and the take after 10
  seconds, the lid, the words over a box, the hunt's words and reads, the result lines,
  the mark by the event before a read, the mark's end by the hub's seconds left or its
  clock; on the hub, the mark picked among hunters in play only and 3 of them, the away
  mark handed on after a minute (or kept with too few others), the kill counted only
  from the mark and for a hunter, the pause, the free roll spent; on the hub, the odds, placing and
  removing as the creator only, the price, the roll, the cooldown and another server's
  box). Not tried in a game; the hub side is deployed (27/10/2026).
