# SJK project wiki

This directory is the canonical project wiki for contributors and AI assistants.
It lives beside the source so implementation and documentation can be reviewed
and changed together. Begin with the status page, then the architecture.

[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) defines the documentation maintenance rules. Update the
page that owns a fact rather than adding a second account elsewhere. New facts
should link to code or identify their verification; proposals must remain labeled
as planned until implemented and checked.

For installation and quick launch commands, see the [project README](../README.md).
